            "content": "You developed a mobile app and want to figure out what your users are talking about in the app reviews. You have thousands of tweets mentioning your product and not enough time to read and digest all of them. Maybe you want to look at your emails from the last 5 years and figure out what you have spent your time on while reading and answering them. . If any of these use cases sounds familiar, you should learn about topic modeling! In this article, I will explore various topic modelling algorithms and approaches. You can also open it in Google Colab and apply on your dataset easily! . Install the libraries . To start with, let&#39;s install three libraries: . datasets will allow us to easily grab a bunch of texts to work with | sentence-transformers will help us create text embeddings (more on that later) | bokeh will help us with visualization | . We will install these libraries and import the functions and classes we will need later on. . !pip install -qq datasets !pip install -Uqq sentence-transformers !pip install -qq bokeh . |████████████████████████████████| 225kB 6.7MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 245kB 8.6MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 112kB 9.2MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 81kB 4.3MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 2.3MB 9.5MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 1.2MB 50.0MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 3.3MB 50.7MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 901kB 48.0MB/s Building wheel for sentence-transformers (setup.py) ... done . from datasets import load_dataset from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import sklearn.manifold import numpy as np import pandas as pd import random random.seed(42) from bokeh.io import output_file, show from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool, LinearColorMapper from bokeh.palettes import plasma, d3, Turbo256 from bokeh.plotting import figure from bokeh.transform import transform import bokeh.io bokeh.io.output_notebook() import bokeh.plotting as bpl import bokeh.models as bmo bpl.output_notebook() . Grab the data . Topic modeling requires a bunch of texts. We don&#39;t need any labels! Let&#39;s grab an English subset of the public Amazon reviews dataset and test if we can get practical insights on the topics and themes represented in those reviews. . dataset = load_dataset(&#39;amazon_reviews_multi&#39;, &#39;en&#39;) .

Subsequent calls will reuse this data. . First Look at the Data . Let&#39;s take a quick look at the data we&#39;ll be working with. Our dataset is a dictionary consisting of three parts: train, validation and test. Let&#39;s peek into the train set and put it into pandas dataframe to see how it&#39;s constructed. . dataset.keys() . dict_keys([&#39;train&#39;, &#39;validation&#39;, &#39;test&#39;]) . df = pd.DataFrame(dataset[&#39;train&#39;]) df.head() . language product_category product_id review_body review_id review_title reviewer_id stars . 0 en | furniture | product_en_0740675 | Arrived broken.

This is useful - we can see that the dataset consists of a number of atributes. We&#39;ll focus on the review_body and try to discover topics in those reviews, but the other attributes can help us to validate if we&#39;re stepping in a good direction. For example, we can compare how our topics correlate with the product_category attribute. Let&#39;s peek into the the categories just to see what we have in the dataset. . df.product_category.value_counts().plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;, figsize=(15,5)); . How can we extract meaning from the review_body though? There are many ways of course. Rather than going bottom up from simple techniques such as key words, n-grams, tf-idf etc., let&#39;s jump straight into the concept of embedding. . Embeddings . A key idea for machine learning is that of representations. Most algorithms can only work with numbers, so whatever we&#39;re dealing with - words, texts, images - we should represent with numbers. We are focusing on texts here, texts can represent many different things, so we also need many numbers - let&#39;s say 768 - for each text. We&#39;ll put these 768 numbers into vectors and use them to represent our texts. These vectors are called embeddings. . For the purpose of these article, we will not worry about where these embeddings come from, other than the fact we can produce them with the SentenceTransformer library. We will load a pretrained model (Distilbert) and use it to encode our texts. . Dimensionality Reduction . 768 numbers for each text is actually less meaningful to a normal person than a text, so how does this help? We can use some magic to reduce these 768 numbers to 2. These magic is called t-SNE and it&#39;s one of several dimensionality reduction techniques (for example PCA or UMAP). It tries to preserve the relative positions of points in a multidimensional space while mapping it to fewer dimensions. With 2 dimensions, we can actually plot these points (texts) on a chart! Let&#39;s do it! . Oh, we have 20.000 texts, so our chart can get really cluttered... Let&#39;s take a 1000 texts sample and use it instead. . model = SentenceTransformer(&#39;stsb-distilbert-base&#39;) . . sample = df.sample(n=1000, random_state=42) texts = sample.review_body.values.tolist() categories = sample.product_category.values.tolist() . embeddings = model.encode(texts) . out = sklearn.manifold.TSNE(n_components=2).fit_transform(embeddings) . Visualization with bokeh . Bokeh is a nice tool that allows us to create interactive charts. We&#39;ll use it to create a scatter plot where each text is placed according to the meaning dimension. Additionally, we&#39;re color each dot to indicate which category it comes from. We can hover over the chart and see the text/category associated with each dot. . clrs = random.sample(Turbo256, len(set(categories)), ) color_map = bmo.CategoricalColorMapper(factors=list(set(categories)), palette=clrs) . list_x = out[:,0] list_y = out[:,1] desc = texts source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=list_x, y=list_y, desc=desc, cat=categories)) hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[ (&quot;index&quot;, &quot;$index&quot;), (&quot;(x,y)&quot;, &quot;(@x, @y)&quot;), (&#39;desc&#39;, &#39;@desc&#39;), (&#39;cat&#39;, &#39;@cat&#39;) ]) p = figure(plot_width=1200, plot_height=600, tools=[hover], title=&quot;First Look at the Data&quot;) p.circle(&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, size=10, source=source, fill_color=transform(&#39;cat&#39;, color_map),) . GlyphRenderer(id&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;1521&#39;, &hellip;)data_source&nbsp;=&nbsp;ColumnDataSource(id=&#39;1495&#39;, ...),glyph&nbsp;=&nbsp;Circle(id=&#39;1519&#39;, ...),hover_glyph&nbsp;=&nbsp;None,js_event_callbacks&nbsp;=&nbsp;{},js_property_callbacks&nbsp;=&nbsp;{},level&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;glyph&#39;,muted&nbsp;=&nbsp;False,muted_glyph&nbsp;=&nbsp;None,name&nbsp;=&nbsp;None,nonselection_glyph&nbsp;=&nbsp;Circle(id=&#39;1520&#39;, ...),selection_glyph&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;auto&#39;,subscribed_events&nbsp;=&nbsp;[],syncable&nbsp;=&nbsp;True,tags&nbsp;=&nbsp;[],view&nbsp;=&nbsp;CDSView(id=&#39;1522&#39;, ...),visible&nbsp;=&nbsp;True,x_range_name&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;default&#39;,y_range_name&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;default&#39;) &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; First Look at the Data . . Looks interesting! If you hover over the distinct clusters on the chart, you should be able to recognize common topics. Some of these topics are related to a single category, some of them are shared across categories. What topics can you find in the chart? . Discovering Topics with BERTopic . Looking at the chart above, we can get a sense for some of the topics in our corpus, but it doesn&#39;t solve our problem yet. It would require lots of time to review the chart in detail, find clusters, and label them. How can we automate this process? . BERTopic is one of the methods to achieve that. It depends on sentence embeddings and clustering algorithms, as well as dimensionality reduction to produce clusters of documents (topics). Let&#39;s if we can get some good insights with this approach. . !pip install bertopic[visualization] -qq . |████████████████████████████████| 81kB 7.2MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 6.4MB 17.6MB/s Installing build dependencies ... done Getting requirements to build wheel ... done Preparing wheel metadata ... done |████████████████████████████████| 13.2MB 23.5MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 1.2MB 55.2MB/s Building wheel for hdbscan (PEP 517) ... done Building wheel for umap-learn (setup.py) ... done Building wheel for pynndescent (setup.py) ... done . from bertopic import BERTopic . model = BERTopic(language=&quot;english&quot;) topics, probs = model.fit_transform(texts) . . len(topics), len(set(topics)) . (1000, 16) . We&#39;ve run the algorithm on our 1000 texts sample, and it identified 18 topics in this corpus. Let&#39;s see if we can learn something more about those topics! . model.get_topic_freq().head(5) . Topic Count . 0 -1 | 414 | . 1 14 | 120 | . 2 13 | 107 | . 3 6 | 97 | . 4 0 | 42 | . Wow, there&#39;s quite a lot of outliers here, represented by topic -1, almost half of the dataset! Let&#39;s take a look at the most frequent topic from this dataset. . model.get_topic(1) . [(&#39;book&#39;, 0.07270137513517926), (&#39;her&#39;, 0.030044146711303992), (&#39;love&#39;, 0.028517513478582623), (&#39;series&#39;, 0.028276909537389094), (&#39;animals&#39;, 0.025088628007254903), (&#39;read&#39;, 0.02494013741398932), (&#39;author&#39;, 0.023676362585969644), (&#39;hero&#39;, 0.020424526484242825), (&#39;heroine&#39;, 0.020424526484242825), (&#39;storyline&#39;, 0.019518916602442885)] . What we typically get with topic modelling is key words associated with each topic. In the case above, we can see key words associated with sizes: size, fit, larger, tight, small. Let&#39;s take a look at some texts associated with this topic to confirm our intuition. . ex_ind = [i for i, x in enumerate(topics) if x == 1] ex_txt = [x for i, x in enumerate(texts) if i in ex_ind] for t in ex_txt[:10]: print(t) . Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can&#39;t help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila. I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series. I loved this book!! Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty&#39;s best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own. The fantasy world is beautifully detailed with magic and tension and tenderness throughout. I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light. This is a great book so far. I haven&#39;t finished it, but I cant wait to! Well worth the great price! The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn’t explain who was whom very well. I want to see how Kevin lives or dies! And does he fall for his best friend eventually? Lots of twists and turns. This was a good short story,and a great deal of action in it. Although most people don&#39;t know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it. Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it’s a fun book! I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery’s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved. . Indeed, most of these texts talk about sizes! Looks like the model is onto something! . BERTopic comes with a visualization capability, showing the intertopic distance map. You can play with it below. . model.visualize_topics() . . . What if we overlay the topics discovered here with our initial scatter plot? Let&#39;s try it! Now, instead of categories, we will color the dots according to the topic assigned by BERTopic algorithm. . topic_words = [&#39;-1: outlier&#39;] for i in range(len(set(topics))-1): tpc = model.get_topic(i)[:7] words = [x[0] for x in tpc] tw = &#39; &#39;.join([str(i) + &#39;:&#39;] + words) topic_words.append(tw) . exp_topics = [topic_words[x+1] for x in topics] . clrs = random.sample(Turbo256, len(set(topics))) color_map = bmo.CategoricalColorMapper(factors=topic_words, palette=clrs) . list_x = out[:,0] list_y = out[:,1] desc = texts source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=list_x, y=list_y, desc=desc, topic=exp_topics)) hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[ (&quot;index&quot;, &quot;$index&quot;), (&#39;desc&#39;, &#39;@desc&#39;), (&#39;topic&#39;, &#39;@topic&#39;) ]) p = figure(plot_width=1200, plot_height=600, tools=[hover], title=&quot;Test&quot;) p.circle(&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, size=10, source=source, fill_color=transform(&#39;topic&#39;, color_map), # legend=&#39;topic&#39; ) # p.legend.location = &quot;top_left&quot; # p.legend.click_policy=&quot;hide&quot; bokeh.plotting.show(p) . In this visual, the topics are clustered together - which makes sense, because the method for creating visual and topics is consistent. Interestingly, when looking at clusters of outliers that are located near each other in the chart, we can see common theme - I wonder why these were tagged as outliers? . LDA with Mallet . Let&#39;s now turn to a classic approach - LDA, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We will not review the theory or the inner workings of this algorithm here. The key difference vs. BERTopic is that each text (document) is considered to be a composition of topics. We don&#39;t cluster documents into topics, but instead discover abstract topics that are represented in a document corpus. For each document, we get the probability distribution over these topics. . Let&#39;s imagine we have discovered three topics: sports, data science, competition. . A document that is about data science competition might have the following distribution: sports: 0.05, data science: 0.5, competition: 0.045. . A document that talks about world championship in cricket migth have the following distribution instead: sports: 0.54, data science: 0.01, competition: 0.45. . There seem to be many implementations of the LDA algorithm, and some of them result in significantly worse results. It also seems that the Mallet implementation is considered one of the best ones, so we will use it here. . To speed things up, I will use the first 10.000 reviews for topic modeling. I will only display 1000 reviews in the t-sne chart. . .

Looking at the chart above, it seems that the topics identified by LDA re not necessarily close to each other on the chart. We know that the chart should align well with topics identified by SentenceBert embeddings, so this confirms that both approaches are complementary and can result in a different set of topics. . My intuition is that BERTopic should work better for shorter documents, that are more likely to represent a single topic, while LDA may handle better longer texts that are likely a combination of topics. Both can offer some good insights into our documents, so it makes sense to try both! . Let&#39;s also look at the LDA topics visualizations through the PyLDAVis library. .

            "title": "Training BERT for Cyberbullying Detection - Towards SOTA",
            "content": "This is a follow up to the previous notebook training a binary classification model that should detect cyberbullying in Polish Tweets. The dataset comes from a Polish NLP competition - PolEval 2019 (http://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6). It is also included in Polish NLP Benchmark KLEJ (https://klejbenchmark.com/). Our goal is to reach state-of-the-art results, with the following points of reference: . Best result in last year competition: 58.58 f1 (n-waves ULMFiT) | Best result for a base BERT model on KLEJ: 66.7 (Polish Roberta base) | Best result for a large BERT model on KLEJ: 72.4 (XLM-RoBERTa large + NKJP) | . To achieve that, we will work with the HuggingFace library and Pytorch. . Setup . Let&#39;s start by installing transformers, and importing the relevant libraries. We will now work mostly with Pytorch. . !pip install transformers -q . |████████████████████████████████| 1.3MB 2.7MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 1.1MB 16.2MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 2.9MB 18.5MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 890kB 53.0MB/s Building wheel for sacremoses (setup.py) ... done . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import torch import torch.nn as nn from sklearn import model_selection, metrics from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support from transformers import AdamW, get_linear_schedule_with_warmup, BertTokenizerFast, BertPreTrainedModel, BertModel, BertConfig from tqdm.autonotebook import tqdm from torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedRandomSampler . Data preparation . Let&#39;s start with downloading the dataset and converting it into a dataframe. . !wget -q https://klejbenchmark.com/static/data/klej_cbd.zip !unzip -q klej_cbd.zip . df = pd.read_csv(&#39;train.tsv&#39;, delimiter=&#39; t&#39;) df.columns = [&#39;text&#39;, &#39;label&#39;] df.label = df.label.astype(int) df = df.dropna().reset_index(drop=True) . We will now switch from a single train-validation split into cross-validation (5 fold). We will be also more careful with the split, applying stratified k-fold split, so that each fold has similar amount of positive labels. With cross-validation, our goal is to benefit from all training data. At the same time, by ensembling the models trained on each fold, we should be reducing random errors, making our ensemble more predictable. . df[&quot;kfold&quot;] = -1 df = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True) kf = model_selection.StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5) for fold, (trn_, val_) in enumerate(kf.split(X=df, y=df.label.values)): df.loc[val_, &#39;kfold&#39;] = fold df.to_csv(&#39;train.csv&#39;, index=False) . We will also apply some pre-processing of the tweets. First, we will replace &#39;@anonymized_account&#39; with &#39;@ użytkownik&#39;. Second, we will replace the emoji characters with their plain text counterparts. Both modifications are based on the Polish Roberta training scripts (https://github.com/sdadas/polish-roberta). These changes should allow the Polish BERT model better represent the text. . emoji = { &#39;😀&#39;: &#39;:D&#39;, &#39;😃&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😄&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😁&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😆&#39;: &#39;xD&#39;, &#39;😅&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🤣&#39;: &#39;xD&#39;, &#39;😂&#39;: &#39;xD&#39;, &#39;🙂&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🙃&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😉&#39;: &#39;;)&#39;, &#39;😊&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😇&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🥰&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;😍&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;🤩&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;😘&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;😗&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;☺&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😚&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;😋&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;😛&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;😜&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;😝&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;🤑&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;🤪&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;🤗&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;🤭&#39;: &#39;:P&#39;, &#39;🤫&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;🤔&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;🤨&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;😐&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;😑&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;😶&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;😏&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😒&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🙄&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;🤐&#39;: &#39;:|&#39;, &#39;😬&#39;: &#39;:$&#39;, &#39;😌&#39;: &#39;zzz&#39;, &#39;😔&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😪&#39;: &#39;zzz&#39;, &#39;🤤&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤒&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤕&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤢&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤮&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤧&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🥵&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🥶&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🥴&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😵&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤯&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤠&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🥳&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😎&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🤓&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;🧐&#39;: &#39;:)&#39;, &#39;😕&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😟&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🙁&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;☹&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😮&#39;: &#39;:O&#39;, &#39;😯&#39;: &#39;:O&#39;, &#39;😲&#39;: &#39;:O&#39;, &#39;😳&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🥺&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😦&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😧&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😨&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😰&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😥&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😢&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😭&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😱&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😖&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😣&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😞&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😓&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😩&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😫&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🥱&#39;: &#39;zzz&#39;, &#39;😤&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😡&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😠&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;🤬&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;😈&#39;: &#39;]:-&gt;&#39;, &#39;👿&#39;: &#39;]:-&gt;&#39;, &#39;💀&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;☠&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;💋&#39;: &#39;:*&#39;, &#39;💔&#39;: &#39;:(&#39;, &#39;💤&#39;: &#39;zzz&#39; } . df[&#39;text&#39;] = df[&#39;text&#39;].apply(lambda r: r.replace(&quot;@anonymized_account&quot;, &quot;@ użytkownik&quot;)) . df[&#39;text&#39;] = df[&#39;text&#39;].apply(lambda r: &quot;&quot;.join((emoji.get(c, c) for c in r))) .

Configuration . Let&#39;s define some key hyperparameters that influence our training: . max length: how many tokens should be used per tweet? Based on the training data, the longest tweet is 91 tokens with Polbert tokenizer, so we will set the max length to 92 tokens and pad all tokens to that length with [PAD] token. | batch size: we will use batch size 64, it might be difficult to use a bigger one on some GPUs | number of epochs: our dataset is fairly small, so training for a large number of epochs might lead to overfitting. Let&#39;s set on 2 epochs here. | learning rate: we will use discriminative learning rate, applying a higher learning rate to the classifier layer (that we start with random weights), and a lower learning rate to the encoder (which has been pretrained so it already should have &#39;good&#39; weights) | warm up: we will be using linear schedule with warm up, so the learning rate will be increased for the number of steps defined here, and then linearly decreased to zero | pretrained model and tokenizer: we will work again with Polbert uncased model | . MAX_LEN = 92 TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 64 VALID_BATCH_SIZE = 64 EPOCHS = 2 LR = 2e-5 HEAD_LR = 1e-4 WARMUP_STEPS = 30 BERT_PATH = &#39;dkleczek/bert-base-polish-uncased-v1&#39; TOKENIZER = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(&#39;dkleczek/bert-base-polish-uncased-v1&#39;) . Pytorch Dataset and Model . Let&#39;s start by defining Pytorch Dataset. It needs to implement the len and getitem methods. We will again use the HuggingFace tokenizer to convert text into input_ids, mask and token_type_ids that are expected by our BERT layer. . class CBDDataset: def __init__(self, text, label): self.text = text self.label = label self.tokenizer = TOKENIZER def __len__(self): return len(self.text) def __getitem__(self, item): text = &#39; &#39;.join(self.text[item].split()) label = self.label[item] enc = self.tokenizer(text, max_length=MAX_LEN, truncation=True, padding=&#39;max_length&#39;, return_tensors=&#39;pt&#39;) return { &#39;ids&#39;: enc.input_ids[0], &#39;mask&#39;: enc.attention_mask[0], &#39;token_type_ids&#39;: enc.token_type_ids[0], &#39;targets&#39;: torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long) } . Now is the time to define our model! First, let&#39;s look at the elements that are normally expected: . bert layer: the entire BERT pretrained model is a single layer in our model. We are using again pretrained weights from HuggingFace hub. | drop out: it&#39;s another hyperparameter that can be tuned, here we set it directly in the model | linear classification layer: this is a binary classification problem with 2 classes (True and False) and we define a linear layer for this. This comes with random weights that we initialize here. | . We are also doing some modifications here that should help us improve the results: . using the full hidden state rather than [CLS] token output: there is some research showing that the last layers of pretrained model are very specific to pretraining task and don&#39;t help in finetuning. We will output all hidden states from the model and use the penultimate layer (-2) for our task | max pooling: we will take the output from all tokens (768 features * 92 tokens) and take the max value for each feature across all tokens. The intutition here is that the model may encode &#39;cyberbullying&#39; in the token representation, and if it&#39;s contained somewhere in a tweet, we should use that information. | . class CBDModel(BertPreTrainedModel): def __init__(self, conf): super(CBDModel, self).__init__(conf) self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained(BERT_PATH, config=conf) self.mx = nn.MaxPool1d(MAX_LEN) self.drop_out = nn.Dropout(0.5) self.l0 = nn.Linear(768, 2) torch.nn.init.normal_(self.l0.weight, std=0.02) def forward(self, ids, mask, token_type_ids): _, _, out = self.bert(ids, attention_mask=mask, token_type_ids=token_type_ids) out = out[-2] out = out.permute(0,2,1) out = torch.squeeze(self.mx(out)) out = self.drop_out(out) out = self.l0(out) return out .

Let&#39;s apply these models on our test set, pre-processed in the same way as our training set.

This looks good! Our F1 score is around 0.66 - 0.68, which is in the range of the best base BERT model on KLEJ Benchmark (Polish Roberta base reported results in the range 0.63-0.69). . Improvements . What can be done to further improve the results? Here are some ideas: . Data augmentation. Can we add more variety/examples via text augmentation? | More hyperparameter tuning. Key watch out is to ensure a good cross-validation approach, so that we don&#39;t tune on the test set. | Multi-sample dropout. This technique was used by winning teams in recent Kaggle NLP competitions. | Multi-lingual transfer. We have large toxicity datasets in English, can we use that with a multi-lingual model like XLM-Roberta to classify Polish Tweets? | Multi-task learning. We could benefit from training a single model on several tasks, e.g. from KLEJ Benchmark, to see if that helps. | Ensembling/Stacking. Ensembling results across models with different encoders and fine-tuning protocols is very likely to improve the score even further. | .",

The dataset comes from a Polish NLP competition - PolEval 2019 (http://2019.poleval.pl/index.php/tasks/task6). It is also included in Polish NLP Benchmark KLEJ (https://klejbenchmark.com/). . Setup . Let&#39;s start by installing two libraries from HuggingFace that will make our job easier: transformers and datasets. We will also import the relevant libraries. . !pip install transformers -qq !pip install datasets -qq . |████████████████████████████████| 1.3MB 3.4MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 890kB 19.2MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 1.1MB 29.8MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 2.9MB 43.7MB/s Building wheel for sacremoses (setup.py) ... done |████████████████████████████████| 153kB 3.3MB/s |████████████████████████████████| 17.7MB 204kB/s |████████████████████████████████| 245kB 64.2MB/s . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import torch from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizerFast, Trainer, TrainingArguments from datasets import load_dataset, Dataset from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support . In this demo, we will use the Polish pretrained BERT model - Polbert (https://github.com/kldarek/polbert). It can be downloaded from the HuggingFace model hub, and we will use BertForSequenceClassification class to load it. We will also need the Polbert tokenizer. . model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(&#39;dkleczek/bert-base-polish-uncased-v1&#39;) tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(&#39;dkleczek/bert-base-polish-uncased-v1&#39;) . .

Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at dkleczek/bert-base-polish-uncased-v1 and are newly initialized: [&#39;classifier.weight&#39;, &#39;classifier.bias&#39;] You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference. . .

            "title": "Top Down Introduction to BERT with HuggingFace and PyTorch",
            "content": "If you&#39;re just getting started with BERT, this article is for you. I will explain the most popular use cases, the inputs and outputs of the model, and how it was trained. I will also provide some intuition into how it works, and will refer your to several excellent guides if you&#39;d like to get deeper. . I&#39;ve spent the last couple of months working on different NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition. BERT has been my starting point for each of these use cases - even though there is a bunch of new transformer-based architectures, it still performs surprisingly well, as evidenced by the recent Kaggle NLP competitions. Eventually, I also ended up training my own BERT model for Polish language and was the first to make it broadly available via HuggingFace library. . Fortunately, you probably won&#39;t need to train your own BERT - pre-trained models are available for many languages, including several Polish language models published now. . HuggingFace and PyTorch . HuggingFace Transformers is an excellent library that makes it easy to apply cutting edge NLP models. I will use their code, such as pipelines, to demonstrate the most popular use cases for BERT. We will need pre-trained model weights, which are also hosted by HuggingFace. I will use PyTorch in some examples. . !pip install transformers -q . from transformers import pipeline, BertTokenizer, BertModel, BertForNextSentencePrediction, BertConfig import torch . What can I use BERT for? . Text classification . Probably the most popular use case for BERT is text classification. This means that we are dealing with sequences of text and want to classify them into discrete categories. . Here are some examples of text sequences and categories: . Movie Review - Sentiment: positive, negative | Product Review - Rating: one to five stars | Email - Intent: product question, pricing question, complaint, other | . Below is a code example of sentiment classification use case. . # Text classification - sentiment analysis nlp = pipeline(&quot;sentiment-analysis&quot;) print(nlp(&quot;This movie was great!&quot;)) print(nlp(&quot;I have just wasted 2 hours of my time.&quot;)) . [{&#39;label&#39;: &#39;POSITIVE&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: 0.6986343860626221}] [{&#39;label&#39;: &#39;NEGATIVE&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: 0.9613907337188721}] . Named Entity Recognition . Sometimes, we&#39;re not interested in the overall text, but specific words in it. Maybe we want to extract the company name from a report. Or the start and end date of hotel reservation from an email. . That means that we need to apply classification at the word level - well, actually BERT doesn&#39;t work with words, but tokens (more on that later on), so let&#39;s call it token classification. . There are existing pre-trained models for common types of named entities, like people names, organization names or locations. Let&#39;s see how this performs on an example text. Note that we will only print out the named entities, the tokens classified in the &#39;Other&#39; category will be ommitted. . # NER / token classification nlp = pipeline(&quot;ner&quot;) sequence = &quot;My name is Darek and I live in Warsaw.&quot; for token in nlp(sequence): print(token) . {&#39;word&#39;: &#39;Dare&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: 0.9987152218818665, &#39;entity&#39;: &#39;I-PER&#39;} {&#39;word&#39;: &#39;##k&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: 0.9988871812820435, &#39;entity&#39;: &#39;I-PER&#39;} {&#39;word&#39;: &#39;Warsaw&#39;, &#39;score&#39;: 0.9978176355361938, &#39;entity&#39;: &#39;I-LOC&#39;} . Question Answering . Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we simply asked a question and got an answer? That is certainly a direction where some of the NLP research is heading (for example T5). BERT can only handle extractive question answering. It means that we provide it with a context, such as a Wikipedia article, and a question related to the context. BERT will find for us the most likely place in the article that contains an answer to our question, or inform us that an answer is not likely to be found. . # Question Answering nlp = pipeline(&quot;question-answering&quot;) context = &quot;My name is Darek. I&#39;m Polish. I like to practice kungfu. My home is in Warsaw but I often travel to Berlin. My friend, Paul, lives in Canada.&quot; print(nlp(question=&quot;Where does Darek live?&quot;, context=context)) print(nlp(question=&quot;Where does Paul live?&quot;, context=context)) . {&#39;score&#39;: 0.8502292525232313, &#39;start&#39;: 71, &#39;end&#39;: 77, &#39;answer&#39;: &#39;Warsaw&#39;} {&#39;score&#39;: 0.9584999083856722, &#39;start&#39;: 134, &#39;end&#39;: 140, &#39;answer&#39;: &#39;Canada.&#39;} . Other use cases and fine-tuning . There are some other interesting use cases for transformer-based models, such as text summarization, text generation, or translation. BERT is not designed to do these tasks specifically, so I will not cover them here. . The examples above are based on pre-trained pipelines, which means that they may be useful for us if our data is similar to what they were trained on. Very often, we will need to fine-tune a pretrained model to fit our data or task. This is much more efficient than training a whole model from scratch, and with few examples we can often achieve very good performance. . To be able to do fine-tuning, we need to understand a bit more about BERT. . What are the inputs to BERT, and what comes out of it? . Let&#39;s start by treating BERT as a black box. The minimum that we need to understand to use the black box is what data to feed into it, and what type of outputs to expect. You can build on top of these outputs, for example by adding one or more linear layers. You can then fine-tune your custom architecture on your data. . Tokenization . Before you feed your text into BERT, you need to turn it into numbers. That&#39;s the role of a tokenizer. Some tokenizers split text on spaces, so that each token corresponds to a word. That would result however in a huge vocabulary, which makes training a model more difficult, so instead BERT relies on sub-word tokenization. Let&#39;s see how it works in code. . Each pre-trained model comes with a pre-trained tokenizer (we can&#39;t separate them), so we need to download it as well. Let&#39;s use it then to tokenize a line of text and see the output. . tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#39;bert-base-uncased&#39;) . text = &#39;I like to practice kungfu.&#39; tokens = tokenizer.encode(text) print(tokens) . [101, 1045, 2066, 2000, 3218, 18577, 11263, 1012, 102] . Each token is a number that corresponds to a word (or subword) in the vocabulary. The most frequent words are represented as a whole word, while less frequent words are divided in sub-words. That ensures that we can map the entire corpus to a fixed size vocabulary without unknown tokens (in reality, they may still come up in rare cases). Let&#39;s see the length of our model&#39;s vocabulary, and how the tokens corresponds to words. . print(f&#39;Length of BERT base vocabulary: {len(tokenizer.vocab)}&#39;) print(f&#39;Text: {text}&#39;) for t in tokens: print(f&#39;Token: {t}, subword: {tokenizer.decode([t])}&#39;) . Length of BERT base vocabulary: 30522 Text: I like to practice kungfu. Token: 101, subword: [CLS] Token: 1045, subword: i Token: 2066, subword: like Token: 2000, subword: to Token: 3218, subword: practice Token: 18577, subword: kung Token: 11263, subword: ##fu Token: 1012, subword: . Token: 102, subword: [SEP] . In the example, you can see how the tokenizer split a less common word &#39;kungfu&#39; into 2 subwords: &#39;kung&#39; and &#39;##fu&#39;. The &#39;##&#39; characters inform us that this subword occurs in the middle of a word. BERT tokenizer also added 2 special tokens for us, that are expected by the model: [CLS] which comes at the beginning of every sequence, and [SEP] that comes at the end. [SEP] may optionally also be used to separate two sequences, for example between question and context in a question answering scenario. Another example of a special token is [PAD], we need to use it to pad shorter sequences in a batch, because BERT expects each example in a batch to have the same amount of tokens. . Outputs . Let&#39;s download a pretrained model now, run our text through it, and see what comes out. We will first need to convert the tokens into tensors, and add the batch size dimension (here, we will work with batch size 1). . model = BertModel.from_pretrained(&#39;bert-base-uncased&#39;) . inputs = torch.tensor(tokens).unsqueeze(0) # Batch size 1 outputs = model(inputs) print(f&#39;output type: {type(outputs)}, output length: {len(outputs)}&#39;) print(f&#39;first item shape: {outputs[0].shape}&#39;) print(f&#39;second item shape: {outputs[1].shape}&#39;) . output type: &lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt;, output length: 2 first item shape: torch.Size([1, 9, 768]) second item shape: torch.Size([1, 768]) . In the examples above, we used BERT to handle some useful tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering. For each of those tasks, a task-specific model head was added on top of raw model outputs. Here, we are dealing with the raw model outputs - we need to understand them to be able to add custom heads to solve our own, specific tasks. . The model outputs a tuple. The first item of the tuple has the following shape: 1 (batch size) x 9 (sequence length) x 768 (the number of hidden units). This is called the sequence output, and it provides the representation of each token in the context of other tokens in the sequence. If we&#39;d like to fine-tune our model for named entity recognition, we will use this output and expect the 768 numbers representing each token in a sequence to inform us if the token corresponds to a named entity. . The second item in the tuple has the shape: 1 (batch size) x 768 (the number of hidden units). It is called the pooled output, and in theory it should represent the entire sequence. It corresponds to the first token in a sequence (the [CLS] token). We can use it in a text classification task - for example when we fine-tune the model for sentiment classification, we&#39;d expect the 768 hidden units of the pooled output to capture the sentiment of the text. . In practice, we may want to use some other way to capture the meaning of the sequence, for example by averaging the sequence output, or even concatenating the hidden states from lower levels. . How was BERT trained? . The models we have been using so far have already been pre-trained, and in some cases fine-tuned as well. What does this actually mean? . Pre-training . In order for a model to solve an NLP task, like sentiment classification, it needs to understand a lot about language. Most of the labelled datasets that we have available are too small to teach our model enough about language. Ideally, we&#39;d like to use all the text we have available, for example all books and the internet. Because it&#39;s hard to label so much text, we create &#39;fake tasks&#39; that will help us achieve our goal without manual labelling. . BERT is trained on a very large corpus using two &#39;fake tasks&#39;: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). In MLM, we randomly hide some tokens in a sequence, and ask the model to predict which tokens are missing. In NSP, we provide our model with two sentences, and ask it to predict if the second sentence follows the first one in our corpus. The intent of these tasks is for our model to be able to represent the meaning of both individual words, and the entire sentences. . nlp = pipeline(&quot;fill-mask&quot;) preds = nlp(f&quot;I am exhausted, it&#39;s been a very {nlp.tokenizer.mask_token} day.&quot;) print(&#39;I am exhausted, it &#39;s been a very ***** day.&#39;) for p in preds: print(nlp.tokenizer.decode([p[&#39;token&#39;]])) preds = nlp(f&quot;I am excited, it&#39;s been a very {nlp.tokenizer.mask_token} day.&quot;) print(&#39;I am excited, it &#39;s been a very ***** day.&#39;) for p in preds: print(nlp.tokenizer.decode([p[&#39;token&#39;]])) . I am exhausted, it&#39;s been a very ***** day. busy exhausting stressful taxing rough I am excited, it&#39;s been a very ***** day. busy exciting productive good nice . tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#39;bert-base-uncased&#39;) model = BertForNextSentencePrediction.from_pretrained(&#39;bert-base-uncased&#39;) first_sentence = &quot;I cut my finger.&quot; second_sentence_right = &quot;The blood started flowing.&quot; second_sentence_wrong = &quot;This website uses cookies.&quot; right = tokenizer.encode_plus(first_sentence, text_pair=second_sentence_right) wrong = tokenizer.encode_plus(first_sentence, text_pair=second_sentence_wrong) r1, r2, r3 = torch.tensor(right[&#39;input_ids&#39;]).unsqueeze(0), torch.tensor(right[&#39;token_type_ids&#39;]).unsqueeze(0), torch.tensor(right[&#39;attention_mask&#39;]).unsqueeze(0) w1, w2, w3 = torch.tensor(wrong[&#39;input_ids&#39;]).unsqueeze(0), torch.tensor(wrong[&#39;token_type_ids&#39;]).unsqueeze(0), torch.tensor(wrong[&#39;attention_mask&#39;]).unsqueeze(0) right_outputs = model(input_ids=r1, token_type_ids=r2, attention_mask=r3) right_seq_relationship_scores = right_outputs[0] wrong_outputs = model(input_ids=w1, token_type_ids=w2, attention_mask=w3) wrong_seq_relationship_scores = wrong_outputs[0] print(first_sentence + &#39; &#39; + second_sentence_right) print(f&#39;Next sentence prediction: {right_seq_relationship_scores.detach().numpy().flatten()[0] &gt; 0}&#39;) print(first_sentence + &#39; &#39; + second_sentence_wrong) print(f&#39;Next sentence prediction: {wrong_seq_relationship_scores.detach().numpy().flatten()[0] &gt; 0}&#39;) . I cut my finger. The blood started flowing. Next sentence prediction: True I cut my finger. This website uses cookies. Next sentence prediction: False . Finetuning . As we can see from the examples above, BERT has learned quite a lot about language during pretraining. That knowledge is represented in its outputs - the hidden units corresponding to tokens in a sequence. We can use that knowledge by adding our own, custom layers on top of BERT outputs, and further training (finetuning) it on our own data. . How does BERT really work? . If training a model is like training a dog, then understanding the internals of BERT is like understanding the anatomy of a dog. It&#39;s not required to effectively train a model, but it can be helpful if you want to do some really advanced stuff, or if you want to understand the limits of what is possible. . I will only scratch the surface here by showing the key ingredients of BERT architecture, and at the end I will point to some additional resources I have found very helpful. . Let&#39;s start by loading up basic BERT configuration and looking what&#39;s inside. . config = BertConfig() config . BertConfig { &#34;attention_probs_dropout_prob&#34;: 0.1, &#34;hidden_act&#34;: &#34;gelu&#34;, &#34;hidden_dropout_prob&#34;: 0.1, &#34;hidden_size&#34;: 768, &#34;initializer_range&#34;: 0.02, &#34;intermediate_size&#34;: 3072, &#34;layer_norm_eps&#34;: 1e-12, &#34;max_position_embeddings&#34;: 512, &#34;model_type&#34;: &#34;bert&#34;, &#34;num_attention_heads&#34;: 12, &#34;num_hidden_layers&#34;: 12, &#34;pad_token_id&#34;: 0, &#34;type_vocab_size&#34;: 2, &#34;vocab_size&#34;: 30522 } . This configuration file lists the key dimensions that determine the size of the model: . 768 hidden size is the number of floats in a vector representing each token in the vocabulary | 30522 is the vocabulary size | We can deal with max 512 tokens in a sequence | The initial embeddings will go through 12 layers of computation, including the application of 12 attention heads and dense layers with 3072 hidden units, to produce our final output, which will again be a vector with 768 units per token | . Let&#39;s briefly look at each major building block of the model architecture. We start with the embedding layer, which maps each vocabulary token to a 768-long embedding. We can also see position embeddings, which are trained to represent the ordering of words in a sequence, and token type embeddings, which are used if we want to distinguish between two sequences (for example question and context). . model = BertModel(config) print(model.embeddings) . BertEmbeddings( (word_embeddings): Embedding(30522, 768, padding_idx=0) (position_embeddings): Embedding(512, 768) (token_type_embeddings): Embedding(2, 768) (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) ) . Then, we pass the embeddings through 12 layers of computation. This starts with self-attention, is followed by an intermediate dense layer with hidden size 3072, and ends with sequence output that we have already seen above. Usually, we will deal with the last hidden state, i.e. the 12th layer. However, to achieve better results, we may sometimes use the layers below as well to represent our sequences, for example by concatenating the last 4 hidden states. . print(f&#39;There are {len(model.encoder.layer)} layers like this in the model architecture:&#39;) print(&#39;&#39;) print(model.encoder.layer[0]) . There are 12 layers like this in the model architecture: BertLayer( (attention): BertAttention( (self): BertSelfAttention( (query): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True) (key): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True) (value): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) ) (output): BertSelfOutput( (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True) (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) ) ) (intermediate): BertIntermediate( (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True) ) (output): BertOutput( (dense): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True) (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) ) ) . Finally, we have the pooled output, which is used in pre-training for the NSP task, and corresponds to the [CLS] token hidden state that goes through another linear layer. . print(model.pooler) . BertPooler( (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True) (activation): Tanh() ) . In this overview, I haven&#39;t explained at all the self-attention mechanism, or the detailed inner workings of BERT. If you&#39;d like to learn further, here are some materials that I have found very useful. .

            "title": "My Transition Into Data Science",
            "content": "For the last couple of years, I’ve been fascinated by the progress of machine learning, and the potential applications it enables. I started a journey of learning, building, researching and designing machine learning applications. In this post, I will share my approach and plans for the future. . Getting started . I started learning a few years ago with the classic Coursera Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. It got me hooked, stirred up my interest in machine learning, provided an intuition into the way it works, but left largely unable to do anything practical about it - if only for the reason that it was based on Octave. I needed a practical challenge, so after my daughter was born, I planned to build an app that would generate nursery rhymes in Polish. I went through the Deep Learning specialisation on Coursera, again by Andrew Ng, which was much more hands on and practical. I experimented with LSTMs to generate the rhymes, found out a lot of practical limitations around machine learning, and ultimately shipped the app - although in the background it used an N-gram based language model, a much more traditional technique. . Another breakthrough in my personal journey was discovering Fast.ai. The courses, the library, the community, and specifically the advice from Fast.ai crew: Jeremy Howard, Rachel Thomas, and Sylvain Gugger, gave me a whole new level of practical skills, understanding and motivation to apply machine learning. It keeps amazing me how we can learn from some of the best teachers in the world, and I’m very grateful for that. . Practice, practice, practice . Outside of my family and machine learning, my great passion is kung fu, so I’m used to regular practice and continuous improvement. In a typical sifu/sensei fashion, Jeremy Howard keeps advising to practice machine learning, experiment with code, develop applications, join Kaggle competitions. For me, Kaggle in particular was a huge boost to my skill level and confidence. I got to develop solutions to practical business problems, including localisation of steel defects, fraud detection, natural question answering and many more. Kaggle platform provides a great way to get started, via starter notebooks and solutions shared by the community, and it provides a way to keep learning and improving by analyzing the final solutions shared by the winning teams. Getting ranked on Kaggle is also a very good credential, in particular for people like me who moved into data science from a different field. . Applications . I’m lucky that my job, which is about identifying and executing ideas to transform business processes with technology, allows me to benefit from my machine learning skills and apply them. I’ve gradually transitioned from a pure manager role to half-manager, half-hands-on practitioner, which I feel results in a higher ROI on my salary and is also much more interesting. Applying machine learning in a big company is subject to multiple constraints though (which is a very sensible approach). I’m compensating for this by working on more ‘crazy’ projects outside of work, which includes some research and some potentially commercial applications, that I’m hoping to reveal in the future. . Blogging . Rachel Thomas wrote a great blog post about blogging. I feel like I’m already late to get this started, but it’s still better to do it now. I’ll keep sharing my learnings, insights, and projects on this blog. I’m especially interested in applying NLP to Polish language, and related applications, so if you’re interested in these topics, do follow me on Twitter! .",
