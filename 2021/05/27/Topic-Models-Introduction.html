<p>You developed a mobile app and want to figure out what your users are talking about in the app reviews. You have thousands of tweets mentioning your product and not enough time to read and digest all of them. Maybe you want to look at your emails from the last 5 years and figure out what you have spent your time on while reading and answering them.</p>
<p>If any of these use cases sounds familiar, you should learn about topic modeling! In this article, I will explore various topic modelling algorithms and approaches. You can also open it in Google Colab and apply on your dataset easily!</p>

<p>This is useful - we can see that the dataset consists of a number of atributes. We'll focus on the <code>review_body</code> and try to discover topics in those reviews, but the other attributes can help us to validate if we're stepping in a good direction. For example, we can compare how our topics correlate with the <code>product_category</code> attribute. Let's peek into the the categories just to see what we have in the dataset.</p>

<p>How can we extract meaning from the <code>review_body</code> though? There are many ways of course. Rather than going bottom up from simple techniques such as key words, n-grams, tf-idf etc., let's jump straight into the concept of embedding.</p>
<h3 id="Embeddings">Embeddings<a class="anchor-link" href="#Embeddings"> </a></h3><p>A key idea for machine learning is that of representations. Most algorithms can only work with numbers, so whatever we're dealing with - words, texts, images - we should represent with numbers. We are focusing on texts here, texts can represent many different things, so we also need many numbers - let's say 768 - for each text. We'll put these 768 numbers into vectors and use them to represent our texts. <strong>These vectors are called embeddings</strong>.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these article, we will not worry about where these embeddings come from, other than the fact we can produce them with the SentenceTransformer library. We will load a pretrained model (Distilbert) and use it to encode our texts.</p>
<h3 id="Dimensionality-Reduction">Dimensionality Reduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Dimensionality-Reduction"> </a></h3><p>768 numbers for each text is actually less meaningful to a normal person than a text, so how does this help? We can use some magic to reduce these 768 numbers to 2. These magic is called <code>t-SNE</code> and it's one of several dimensionality reduction techniques (for example <code>PCA</code> or <code>UMAP</code>). It tries to preserve the relative positions of points in a multidimensional space while mapping it to fewer dimensions. With 2 dimensions, we can actually plot these points (texts) on a chart! Let's do it!</p>
<p>Oh, we have 20.000 texts, so our chart can get really cluttered... Let's take a 1000 texts sample and use it instead.</p>

strong enough to run a small 120v vacuum cleaner, to clean car.","The leg openings are a little small, but other than that the suit fits nicely, and is high quality material. Edit: I have been wearing this for less than two months and it is 100% worn out. It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it\u2019s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.","Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.","Well it\u2019s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that\u2019s a lie it has 3 so that\u2019s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it\u2019s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better","Very, very thin, you can bend them with you fingers with no problem! Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!","Super cute! Loved it until I noticed that the casing around the purple rock was coming apart straight out of the package. SAD!","Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3\" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.","These bags have a lot of space in them, good thing about these bags is that I can easily see what's inside then. Very reasonable price.","Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.","Broke down after a month's use!!","Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module","Nice looks like picture","Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it! Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!","I\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.","Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure","Item was not sealed and was missing parts","There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.","Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.","It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.","Buy this light. For the price you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing.","Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can't help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila.","This was never received...","Stitching came undone immediately. Already took tags off so couldn't return. Disappointed.","Seems to be working for my older dog. The vet recommended this brand.","The USB was configured incorrectly to fit into my 2016 Hyundai Sonata. When I turned it over so that the USB would connect, the audio connector was on the wrong side. Won't work at all!","Have not received over a month ago I ordered this","Only gave one because couldn\u2019t leave no stars. This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it\u2019s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either","Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.","Great prices and props for my photo booth company.","I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn\u2019t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I\u2019ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.","Its perfect for my purpose, its lite weight is perfect, and so soft and warm. I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.","When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this","The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.","unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!","It's a fast charger but it doesn't charge the phone as fast as my plug in. It's nice but a fast cord charger is better.","Perfect Christmas gift for my sister! She loved them. The bands are very difficult to change!","The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.","Some of the designs are hard to recognize.","Sadly, the pages were alllllll but 3 riped from the book. I wanted to return it but I was involved in a car accident and was unable to. But I\u2019m disappointed that it was sent out in that condition.","Not very powerful. Noisy.","Beautiful shoes but rhinestone fall off. Found two and replaced them with glue but have lost some permanently. Still like the shoes.","Nice color. My cabinet looks like new.","It\u2019s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\u2019m off my feet because I don\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else","Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.","Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.","Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.","Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.","Did not charge my psp well at all","Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.","Have not used this because we cannot figure this out","Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!","Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced. I checked the local Ace hardware store, thinking it would have to be cheaper, but the flapper on Amazon was actually three bucks cheaper.","Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.","Stick well, peel easy and stay on the wall. Exactly what I was hoping for my nursery. We had painted the walls and no damage done.","the hinge broke after one year - not even a year of heavy use.","That's make me cough be better","I have long, fine hair. These are hard to put in &amp; pull my hair when I take them out.","A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.","Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\u2019s a Jeep and we\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\u2019t chipped, I\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).","We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.","Too big for my face. Look good &amp; packages good!! Quick delivery!","It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!","Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.","I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars","From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.","I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality &amp; printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.","I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are. It is tight on the calves and arms.","It was a nice product over all but trimmer Broke after a month.","4/5 from a satisfied customer. I saw a similar product advertised on Facebook and searched for it on Amazon. This was the same product I saw and cheaper. It performs as its supposed to. Unfortunately the size of the glove is too big for my hand.","Product only lasted probably 10hrs before shorting out. Used it in bass amp for concerts. Would definitely purchase professional quality next time.","This is not for kids. Horrible. Bloody shark swimming around saying it will of into your room and you will meet your doom. Who approved this and rated it as G?!","Great case overall, it's very hard and protects the phone very well. Only thing I dislike a little is the buttons are a bit hard to press, but you get used to over time.","never really worked. unable to get it to work..","Product as discribed, cracks very easily though. Seems cheap","The company sent me another one as the first bracelet broke in a few days, well this is bracelet number 2 delivered on Monday and broke in the same spot. The quality is just not up to par. I have reached out to the seller because I do in fact need a bracelet that is reliable","I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly","Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient","My bird family that lives in our back yard loved this bird food. They are flying in from the neighborhood. Thank you for providing nourishment and joy to my family of birds.","Granddaughter loved it, she\u2019s into anything strawberry!","Warm and dry. Good fit around ankle for support.","Pretty decent and sharp but the middle section gets stuck sometimes...kinda annoying","Great bag... just wish it had an extra pocket inside.","Loved it..... a gift that I did not think I would use.... I was wrong. It is great!","I dislike the fit it\u2019s very cheep wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone","My son really wanted this hoodie so when it arrived he was pleased. It is very thin however and there were several loose threads. The style is neat and different. For the price I was expecting something a little bit better quality however.","Its o.k. but not as thick as another brand I previously used. I think the other brand lasted longer in my hair for the day.","Ordered for my son who is deployed and he loved it!! He said it was the perfect pre workout!","Just what the doctor ordered. Love the flexibility and range of temperatures.","I wish I could give 5 stars. As far as the glasses go, I absolutely love them. But three glasses arrived completely shattered","They are sticky but probably because of the heat -- they were in the mail box and we had high temps in AR","Helpful on my trip to the UK. The computer chargeing ports are a nice extra","Bought these to cycle through a newly bought shotgun. Did not jam.","We received this today. It's beautiful. Love the shiny chrome. Easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. Just needed to open up the battery compartment to add six AA batteries and the liquid hand soap. Screwed in the three screws and placed it on our bathroom wall. Works like a charm!","It made it so much easier to rotate my inside plants!","Solid construction. Not as flimsy as the other inexpensive type C cords out there.","This is a well-made, very attractive alarm. I received an outdated instructions sheet so when I emailed the company with a question, I received immediate, helpful response. I\u2019m very impressed with this company.","Not easy to use at all","I thought i was receiving two dog jackets. As shown in the picture. I only received the red coat. Picture is misleading and i am disappointed. I am a frequent buyer from amazon. Very disappointed, misleading with the picture above.","It was ok needs jewellery to make it look great.","Spring is not easy to use. The other items are great","This is my second one from Oh La La Cheri because it fits perfectly, is actually open crotch in the right spot, is comfortable and made well enough to last a while. My fianc\u00e9 loves it.","Ink smudges every 2 inches on right edge of paper, all copies , not quality I need to be sending to clients, learned my lesson , 14 $ for two cartridges , will go back to others I ordered that worked fine, pay a little more , get it done right the first time","worst smells like chemicals I hate it never bought powder worst than this afraid to use and get an acne","I have never ordered this brand but heard great things, not sure if those brown areas are normal or not","They\u2019re great, durable and fit well. I do recommend setting them outdoors to air out for a few days until you put them in your car.","These show with every pair of shoes I have tried then with. They have seams on the toes which make them uncomfortable.","These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.","For some reason, I bought these to ride my bike with in the cold. They suck for that. Not bad for just walking around, though. I didn't know they were touchscreen compatible til I saw the description again, so I can't comment on how well they work on a cellphone.","The size was off, I usually wear a lrg. or x-lrg. But this was snug I wanted to order larger but was sold out.","Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.","Great product. Delivered timely.","This fascinator looked cute when I did not move, but it was too heavy to stay in place. I used the clip on the headband, but the whole thing kept falling forward on my forehead. At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)","Nice pair of leggings. Very comfortable. I haven\u2019t wash them yet but they seem safe. If not, I\u2019ll update.","Horrible tool. Went to loosen a bolt and the head of the tool broke.","I purchased this item to use for my sons prom send off, the only balloons that were able to be used were the latex ones, no foil balloons could be used, also the discription shows a 2018, I was sent a 2019, which means the day of prom last minute I had to go and purchase the correct numbers which cost me an extra 40 dollars... I'm so disappointed..","Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.","Very good toy. Very tuff to.","2 of my markers were dry. The f Green and purple markers were completely dry. Unsatisfactory","Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library before buying this book. Wish I had. Trust your gut instinct. That's it. Nothing more.","I like them because sometimes you order thing that are not the size they say. these are large the size they say love them.","Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18\" long 1/2\" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2\" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2\" angle iron, each 15\" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.","Much smaller than anticipated, the picture looks like it\u2019s a man\u2019s bracelet when in reality it\u2019s more for a woman. The clasp is impossible to use one handed making it impossible to put on alone, must have help. I will be returning and not recommending this to anyone.","Very nice keepsake box, Purchased for a gift.","I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.","best buy is at Costco or Smith&amp;Final","I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.","The shot glasses are all scratched up. Poor quality. Will not but again.","The antelope color is not the same as I expected it to be. Looks different online.","looks better in person than online. somewhat hard to tighten the band by yourself, also can be uncomfortable if you tighten too much since it is not a flexible band.","The top was a bit tight and I'm a 36 B. I got a medium. I prob would still wear top but underboob is inevitable since the straps are not adjustable. Otherwise the top was cute. Bottoms fit weird and where the strappy parts are on each side the inner lining (tan/white material) showed no matter what and looked super odd. Not cute at all. Maybe I am just too wide for them. I have a 26\" waist. Def for SHORT PETITE people.","These are inedible. I am a health food freak and I have tried many products over the years that have been awful tasting but this tops the cake. I have never tasted a cough drop so disgusting in my life","The product just work a few days, and broken.","I gave this mascara 2 stars, because I would love to use it; although I cannot. The wand is in very poor condition, the brush fibers are falling off and are crushed. For $28 I am very, very disappointed. It did not appear in great, new condition when it arrived.","I am vision impaired and thought this tape would highlight places I need to see. I left it in the sun for a day, applied it, and hoped for the best. Result? Nothing. I can tell the tape is there only by feeling.","This chair is fine. It's a little too rolly, also it doesn't recline unless you pull the lever, which is a little weird but I guess I get it. Okay chair--you get what you pay for.","Very happy with my purchase. It was an excellent price, and the product was just as described, Looks great in my home theater!","Purchased this and one week later it failed. Cannot reach Polycom for replacement. Returning to Amazon as defective.","This was a gift for my grandson. He was so disappointed because there were no lights or sounds as it said on the box. The drill only turned one way. Not happy with it at all.","I bought two chairs and was super excited to put them together. These are definitely cute and are nice quality. The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the \u201cneck\u201d piece, the other didn\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don\u2019t screw them in as far, you\u2019re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.","Great quality for a reasonable price. I used this at a baby shower I hosted and everyone was impressed! SO pretty!!","I loved this book!! Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty's best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own. The fantasy world is beautifully detailed with magic and tension and tenderness throughout.","Got this for my 7 year old. He loves police officers and this puppet was the perfect size for him. Gives him hours of enjoyment too. This was shipped out fast and very well made. I highly recommend.","I bought this a little over three months ago, and while I thought it was a good bag up until now, the bag's strap snapped as I picked it up while leaving the gym. I'd recommend this bag if you need something on the cheaper side but I'm not sure if just my bag is like this or if this is routine.","Lasted a whopping two weeks before it ripped with minimal usage of my AirPods. Not worth the money but too late to return. On the plus size, it was easy to install and looked really nice before it ripped. Maybe I got a bad batch?","I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!","Bought as a new one, but it was used! Verry disappointed!","Nunchuck plug doesn't fit well.. and falls apart upon removal. Also loses sync with wii frequently.","Update: Its ok diaper cream. It separates very easily and it does have a very ROSE LIKE smell. I am still going to use it but not sure I will keep using this brand. I prefer the Target and Walmart brand better so far.","So soft. Just watch the stitching","Works well. So do real cameras :) would buy again.","Overall product is well constructed, Holds a charge well 2 or 3 uses before recharging. The fit is well for me and my wife however,the range is only about 4 tractor trailer lengths away before losing contact and the sound quality is not what I expected for what I paid...its not a packed crisp sound...but more or less a crackly weak sound, not a bad product , I just want the reader to know what yo expect before you spend over 300.00 like I did expecting a little more.","It's a decent hat for the price. For me, the stitching was odd so the hat looked cheaply made. But that's just me, I'm quite picky. Overall it's a decent hat for the price.","Just got the case and it\u2019s too small. What the heck??? Anyone else had this problem???","I use this product in my bedroom which is facing south with too much sunlight. This curtain works well blocking the sunlight. And the price is good.","I used these strips for accent lighting behind my PC monitor and under the shelf that it sits on. Very easy to install and operate. The instructions are very clear for setup and couldn\u2019t have been easier to follow. I wish I could find one or two more of the extension/connector cables by themselves that match what\u2019s in the package so I can put these strips in different places for various lighting, but I guess I\u2019ll have to stick with what I have.","I really want to give this suit a 5 star but I can\u2019t. The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size. It all fits there but the cup size in a xxl looks as if it is a triple d or a double d. I am a larger girl being 249 but my chest is smaller. Would love to exchange sizes but cant find anywhere to message sender.","I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light.","Is OK but runs small","Our son loves this costume, I don\u2019t, necessarily because the picture online makes it appear to be a shiny and body fitting costume but it is not. The shiny part is actually white designs and not necessarily body fitting. It is padded which I do like.","I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don\u2019t have something underneath. They are good quality though.","i loved it! it came in great condition as well","I just wish it would save the names.","The leash was good before it ripped. My dog is 45 pounds, order the medium, she is strong and pulls sometimes, but is not a persistent puller. The leash ripped and is no longer usable after 4 months...","I have lots of problems with this rice cooker because the liquid often steams out and the rice doesn't get enough liquid. There is no hole in the lid to allow some steam out.","wire broke off on inside","i think that says it all .","I read anothers review of this item and agree, the doors are tough to hang straight. Also be careful of the backing screws as in the middle front lower shelf you can see how the screws broke away the bottom shelf. Otherwise its great!","I wasn't so excited to get this float but I will be returning it. Immediately upon inflating it I discovered a large tear in the stitching. The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.","nice gag gift but rather small","Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you\u2019d want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!","Watch came without extra sizing links. Cannot purchase the links without purchasing a new $180 band. Will be returning","They are comfortable except hard to get used to with the controls ..... buttons in odd places","Was a baby shower gift that was on the baby register list. Got a very nice thank you card.","Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read","Feels quality for the price. As advertised.","I like the colors and the staying power of these glosses. A good value for my money. They are a bit sticky so only 4 stars.","Very disappointed with these balloons. One of the big rings came with a hole in it and another two balloons popped as I was filling them with helium.","This doesn\u2019t play well. Pauses in places and will not load the rest of the movie. Could only watch to first 50 mins.","One star because I couldn\u2019t not leave 0. This case does not work, when I did the stress test it worked but when I took it in the water, it was not water proof. This at best is water resistant","Great flavor but not sure if it actually works","The dress had little holes in multiple places, unable to return it, didn\u2019t notice until I wore it and others pointed out the holes! I guess when you buy cheap clothes you get cheap quality!","We ordered a 24 pack and received only a 12 pack","This a great case for the price. It looks great while also providing the protection that I need for my iPhone.","This does seem to extend the length of my manicure but I don't find it the miracle product others do. I get maybe 5-7 days instead of 2-3 out of my polish with this.","I initially purchased this plan to cover a dash cam from defects, accidental damage, ect, but when it came time to file a claim, the company refused to cover my accidental damage claim, and I had to jump through hoops showing them proof of purchase of my insurance plan, because apparently, the insurance plan ID for some reason wasn't enough. I've dealt with asurion before and I've never had problems like this, so insure your purchased Amazon goods at your own risk.","This is a great book so far. I haven't finished it, but I cant wait to! Well worth the great price!","these eyelashes are actually pretty decent if you are looking for a more natural look. they are very lightweight and flexible for easy application, not thick at all.","Excellent product - feels great and very therapeutic. My massage therapist recommended this for reflexology.","I\u2019m disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.","Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.","I have found it really hard to put on magnetic lashes that have 2 magnetic bars per lash. They are difficult to line up both at the same time, and they aren't as long as a realistic lash line. I ended up cutting each lash pairing in half so they are smaller chunks with one magnetic bar per lash set. This is much easier and looks better.","The things I liked most about this product are the attractiveness of it and it's light weight. There are no downsides that I can see.","It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.","I like the color and design of this toaster. It fits perfectly in my kitchen counter top. Bread toasts uniformly and can remove bread crumbles from the bottom tray. I highly Recommend this.","Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.","Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume","I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.","Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.","Since I installed the head, I have noticed a slight vibration. Although it still does the job will","Great info from a history buff","Was amazing for the first 2 weeks, and then my armpits became so irritated that I had to quit using!","Did not receive Entire Order. Called &amp; cancel the part of the order I didn't receive. I was told I would Have a refund &amp; someone would call me. NO calls or contact , or refund at this point &amp; time ??????","Poor finish, Poor fit. Cut my finger on the jagged finish. Holes didn't line up. Shipped back the same day and I had to pay for shipping. BOOO.","I ordered this because I love Cuban coffee that I drink while I\u2019m on Florida. It did not live up to its name. Will not order again.","Nice thick shirt, good quality. No issues with the prints being off. Usually wear XL and the XL size fit perfectly. The design and color are awesome. Would recommend!","This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars","Not the best quality. Some arrived broken.","My baby loves the baby gym. As soon as I lay her down on it her eyes light up with joy and there is a smile from ear to ear. She laughs and giggles and has the best time with it. Honestly, great gift for any mom or great for your own child too. The babies love it! This product is 5 stars","I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I\u2019m rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.","Open the box and discover a top side snap already cracked. I want to give this a chance but wonder about the durability of this product now.","Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy","Very very wide shoes. Only good for babies with extreme foot chub in comparison to foot length. The velcro also doesn't hold well at all. Super cute, though.","They are pretty cool, but don\u2019t drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.","The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height","*** update The handles have worn out and one of them broke off. I still use it but it's no longer as useful. At least it still holds stuff. Original comment: Works great. Durable. I ended up buying 2 of these after having my first. Do wish there was some sort of expandable strap for carrying on shoulder or in one hand. Great product.","Spring clip is too weak, jewelry is easily lost. disappointed","Stopped working after 3rd light yard work. Chain just scrolls. Too late for Amazon return. I liked how lightweight it was.","i never received this item","Hard to get excited about Snap Ring fasteners/washers. I needed two for grocery cart wheel replacement, anyone need the rest ???","We like that it\u2019s insulated and we like that it\u2019s unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don\u2019t know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.","Seems like a good idea but I found I didn\u2019t really need it.","Way too small. I got a large for my 9.5 feet and can't get it on.","While they may be effective if your cat will eat it, mine turned up her nose to these hairball treats.","Great quality glass screen protector. So much better deal than getting it at the cell phone store. The screen is a nice thickness and is super easy to apply. You don't have to mess with any bubbles or anything. Great price and great screen protector!","These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.","I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.","This cookie cutter is so small!","Bought for car, but the base is smaller than the top, so it toppled over very easily. Perfect size, not great execution","Wow, this protein powder can get so fluffy &amp; light! If you are a fan of protein fluff, this is by far the best product! No xantham gum needed!!","Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.","Made my first bars in this today. I ordered it because it was a favorite of Sally's Baking Addiction. This is a high quality pan.","Being African-American, my hair/scalp is naturally dry and I can't wash it more than once a week or it becomes brittle. Maui Moisture is the first shampoo in a long time to help hold the moisture until the next time I can wash my hair. Really happy I found it.","Smaller than I expected !! It will do \ud83d\udc4d","Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.","Came in a box with other items I ordered all of which are fine, but the ceramic casserole was wrapped in a thin bubble wrap which is not sufficient to protecting it. So now, it\u2019s smashed. Do I really have to send back this garbage?","This works fantastic on vinyl .","Do not buy, it will crush your bullets.","Bought these one pulled apart the 1st night used. Another quit 3rd. Time used. Giving 2 to see how the last 2 hold up.","The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn\u2019t explain who was whom very well.","I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.","Not as durable or water resistant. Case pops open every drop","Product is not as described. Not a one+ cable at all. Not even a cheap knock off.","haven\u2019t used the refills yet. Got this as an accompaniment to a tactical pen. Expect it perform nicely","can't say too much about it.. arrived with glass lens broken and had to return","Not an unlocked phone ... a VERIZON phone belonging to someone ... missing accessories.","This is a prob with seller.. I ordered this product Sept. 16, 2019 and ordered two which gave me four balls for the toy which used. 1. I received a pack of two today which I did not order. I never put it on auto order either. I don't want anyone choosing what and when I order my stuff. Now I am chg for this and I may have enough already for the year. The batters will be dead by the time I use the one sent today. What is going other. Never hd any problems with other seller. I am not happy! The balls are wonderful otherwise.","I really like the design of the backpack, but it is not practical for a college student. This is a good backpack to hold maybe 2 books. There\u2019s days where I walk almost 2 miles because of my classes and my back is hurting and aching. It\u2019s a very bulky backpack and doesn\u2019t fit much in it. I have to shove things back in if I take something out. I also cannot have my 15\u201d laptop in it without taking something else out. It also smelled strong of plastic when I first got it. I\u2019m going to be upgrading from this backpack.","I love the product. I feel more energetic after a few weeks of taking this.","I did not like the way they were packaged. There was huge tacks that You had to pull out so it ripped mine","Not one single cable worked! All of them say \u2018the accessory may not be supported.","Easy to assemble and sturdy, light enough to pick up and move, and the speakers sound great. However, this chair is far from comfortable. you sink into the chair for lack of cushion, and you can feel the front board in the chair on the back of your legs. Also, the curve at the lumbar portion of the chair arcs your back and causes pain after a short time. Recommend extra padding/lumbar support if you get this chair.","Too small for my dog","Great handle, 4 stars because it took nearly a month to arrive. Should have read they were coming direct from China.","my granddaughter wears them but the shoe itself is large","Works great took the squeaking out and looks great","I bought two units and overall love the mobile music. Both units were processed the exact same. While listening to them, my second unit's battery only lasted about 20 hours. The first unit still showed full charge! I just downloaded the Monster phone app so going to see how that works later today. Great sound, variable battery life.","Works great. I had this skin tag on my face, I used it multiple times to get rid of my skin tag. I finally got rid of it, it does irritate the surrounding area after using it, make sure you put a medical tape on the tag after applying the solution to minimize redness and irritation. Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, it did exactly what was advertised.","I love this! So many options for fruit teas and water. So easy, it almost makes itself. The lid will strain the fruit as it pours.","Is not what I expected. Memory foam too thin.looks nice.","You will need to pump ut up a lot to get more than a single spray from this. Disappointing but looks nice if you don't mind the extra work.","No assembly was nice. Made in America \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Arrived in open box, one bent stake which I managed to straighten, no packing slip (probably due to completely open box) Perfect addition to the garden. Would purchase again.","Does not even work. wasted my money.","There isnt enough glue to stick it on your eye and make it stay. Not worth the money and it isnt eligible for returns sadly.","This is on my wall of clocks","I only used this swim cap twice a week for two months and it tore. Pretty disappointing since I have the same cap in another color that I have used for a year and a half with no problems. Just wanted a different color.","Lightning plug sunk down in just over a month and the adapter was unable to be repaired.","Fake!! These are fake pens. They do not work!! I ordered these to use as back up to my digital bill detector. I keep a fake $100 in the office of my restaurant to help train staff. It\u2019s a known fake. The digital detector caught the bill so I know it\u2019s fake. These pens show that it\u2019s real!! I have other fake bills used for training staff and it says those are real as well. Come on amazon!! Stop letting people sell fake stuff on here!!","One fits, the other falls off. Poor quality control in the sizing and construction. Soles are hard rubber and sound like dress shoes on hardwood floors, so not very optimal for indoor use.","It take forever for the polish to come off with these pads","Good quality. Comfy.","the loop on the handle broke after a couple of uses.","One of the four bulbs was defective and would not work","OMG...I bought this for my 4 year old grand daughter. It is perfect for the desk we just got her. First of all she can't break it. she can twist and turn it. There is no plug so it is portable...it charges with a USB cord which is provided by the way. The light dims and brighten...can be used as a nightlight also. Lastly,,,it has a pencil holder. It is the cutest light ever. I do recommend","This book was chosen for book club. I was initially interested and then quickly lost interest. I found it hard to follow at times and lost interest quickly. It was hard to finish and I only had about 15 pages left to read before book club and just never had the interest to finish the last pages.....","a little flimsy but doesn't show in presentation. used these for my students water colors for a gallery show. everyone was impressed how nice things look. would recommend for student work.","Well worked great for like 3 days but then started falling apart","Not what it looks like","My kids and grandkids love this item. It is a good transport for sports, picnics, camping, and more for this active family. Th quality of this product is very high; it folds and stores very nicely.","Decent quality jumpers at a good price. Don't put too much strain on these, they're not meant for them. Get a 90deg adapter instead.","I want to see how Kevin lives or dies! And does he fall for his best friend eventually? Lots of twists and turns.","Only giving it three stars because the charger works fine, but I put a screen protector on 3 days ago and it\u2019s already cracked. I don\u2019t do anything ridiculously rough to my watch but it shouldn\u2019t crack after three days.","These r very nice. Big and good quality.","I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.","I bought two sets of them and one set came with the middle diamonds being clear and smaller.","The pens themselves are nice, espcially for the price. However, the ink is terrible. I\u2019ve had these pens for a month and both are struggling to write.","Be careful, the small allen screw that holds the light stripped after adjustment. The company should at least use stronger material screws.","Purchased 8 months ago and both broken now.","Beautiful item but the glass cross was broken in 4 pieces when I opened the box due to no packing material. Needed ASAP for a gift.","This item is exactly what we needed and ordered. It works and is compatible with our i phones.","It looks easier than it is. I ran around trying to fill this thing with air and it took several tries. I looked ridiculous. Finally got enough air in it to make it work. I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner. Not able to get the water out...and worried about mold...it ended up in the trash. Pretty bummed. The idea is great if it had worked for us.","So I thought I would be getting some type of a \"minty orange\" lifesaver....(I wonder why? Look at the name of them!!!) WHen I tried my first one....Nope...NO \"mint\"! It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice \"bright\" flavor over \"Mint\"....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good! Just not \"mints\" as they state....","Slightly off white and loose","Love this dress, I probably should order a smaller size since it is a bit loose in the top and very long on me.","The waist is too high and the bottom too long. I could get away with it but I like my leggings to be be fitted. I might have them altered or I send them back. Not sure yet. Fabric is on the thin size but not see through. Expected for the price. I am 5.2 so I would recommend for taller people! It adjusts well to my size which I am small/medium legging size. Perhaps they could create a petite size!","Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark &amp; seem to be of cheaper quality","I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.","Needed to flash it to get it working with my NVR system (shinobi). Seems to be working now.","Talk about a POS!! I ordered this to replace a broken cover on my iPad. I got this and while putting it on my iPad it BROKE! Super cheap material and I so disappointed with the quality that I put the new and old screen covers in the trash! Don't waste your money as this will just disappoint you.","Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.","This is a great product; however, the powder doesn't blend completely.","Ordered a tinted they shipped me a clear one","I've had a Roomba. It died after several years of hard use. It worked on hard flooring and rugs. This eufy RoboVac is a piece of crap. I'll be returning it. It does not work on floors with rugs even thin low ones. It gets stuck constantly and can't get itself out of it. After this experience I'll buy another Roomba.","The directions that came with the crib for assembly, were completely wrong. It was not as easy to put together as expected. Other than, the crib is great and is good for small spaces.","I love the look and lightness of this wig! The only issue for me is that it does not come with combs or a front lace. However, I purchased a wig grip and it stays in place perfectly! Will buy again!","Loved it soooo much I ordered another set!","Worked great on the first bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner, when I switched them to the new bottles 1 of them quit working.","I have wavy hair and I thought this would enhance my waves. It did nothing actually and didn't tame the frizz at all. I'm highly disappointed.","Meh. They cut out some noise, but don't make a great seal. Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.","It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.","Light weight, easy to place on your car for mounting your phone. Great for young adults","Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.","I've never used a knife sharpening stone so this was interesting. Sharpened my knives quite well. It has been hard to find something that works in sharpening my kitchen knives, this worked.","so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can \"grab\" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally \"modified\" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.","My son loved it, because he much prefers the xbox control layout over the nintendo switch layout.","As soon as i got this product and one half dont work","I could not get the lights to stay in position. I tried tightening them but got no better results. I wanted to aim them where the light would be best for my seedlings and was not satisfied with the results.","The second day (in a row) we used it, didn't hold the air anymore.","Sadly, it was too small.","The quality is very poor and is not 3000PSI Wast of money RIP OFF","I was disappointed that these were a jersey material with a wired bow design not bandana material. They are a little big for my head but they are cute and comfy.","I,ve used Franklin Covey Planners for over 20 years. I have found them extremely helpful in tracking my work-I,m an attorney. While other attorneys use their phone or an I-Pad as a Calendar I can look up my cases and dates much faster.","they are nice but not as good of a material as i would have liked.","Found myself casually perusing ornamental rugs when I came across this beauty and decided to pull the trigger. So far Im really satisfied with the purchase. It looks good, feels better, and welcomes my wrist home every day. 10/10 for the money. I would trust this mousepad in my family home.","This was a good short story,and a great deal of action in it. Although most people don't know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it.","My son used this for approx. 5 months and it's got holes on the bottom fabric and sides (in various places). I would not spend $100 on a product that doesn't even last. Disappointed.","I returned to this product","So so pipe, low quality and it hits funny. Wouldn't recommend it.","Great pump but the gauge is waaaaaay off","Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it\u2019s a fun book!","Simple enough, thin enough... but using the flash sometimes bleeds into the transparent plastic and glares it back into the camera lens... That's the only big problem with this, but in terms of protection? Top notch.","I\u2019ve only been using it for a week and the silicone is already ripped on the side of some keys. The durability is not good.","It was advertised as cotton but was not, sure it was rayon. Also ran small and very see through","The shirt is OK quality, but the sleeves are so tight I don't know how it could be comfortable for anyone.","These had good flavor. I wish they'd leave the nuts out. Very dry","My 1st HDMI switch. Tried it and it wouldn't detect that my PS4 Pro was 4K. Later on the HDMI ports stopped working. Tried different HDMI cables and they still would not work. Not sure if I just got a defective one or if this is how it normally works. Guess I'll be trying a different HDMI switch.","If you are looking for a pillow to help balance your back this is NOT it!","Never could get it to work","These leak. I thought it was me at first, but nope. These definitely leak. The soft ring is in place, the lid is screwed tight, the flip top is secured down. Still leaks. I put my smoothie in a plastic zip bag so it won't get all over, which ends up wasteful.","Great quality but too big","This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf","Not good quality and fit small","Feels pleasant and leaves skin soft, but no visible lifting. Not worth the cost.","These glasses are huge and they don't fit properly. They want to charge shipping to return them so I guess I'll try and give them away. Bad purchase.","These boot run a little large on the size 10w. I would buy again just as a 9.5 or even a 9","Fragile handle with care","Tiny little out of the way quick charger up side is both USB docks are fast charge not one lower &amp; light is not near as irritating while driving at night","The only reason I had to buy a new charger was cause my old one had the rubber broken off the cord and it was a hazard to keep around my baby. I had that charger for 4 years. I got this one and it lasted 1 year and it was giving me small problems a 4 months after having it.","Very easy to install. No hassle at all.","I was looking more of a bath pillow...pillow if that makes any sense but, this is not the product for it, I see that many people were happy when I was browsing, but it was for me","Very pretty design. I was looking to replace my cloth placemats because I was honestly tired of washing them! These are VERY thin. I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn\u2019t think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I\u2019m not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper! But they look pretty and easy to wipe clean so I\u2019ll see how the durability rates as I put them to use.","Is okay but too hard to get cards out. If you have alot of cards and you push and try to fan them out sometimes cards go flying. would be better without money clip. Elastic for cash would be better.","I love this product but one of the bottles we received does not spray correctly and we had to throw it out. Otherwise, the smell is awesome and great for making smells disappear quickly.","It's listed as a three pack, but it's only 2.","I use it to support my neck while I sleep, because I can't sleep on pillows.","The great thing about this is the POE power supply directly from the DVR saving you a ton of work. You only have to mount the cameras and run the wires (supplied) plug them up and start your settings. I can view my 4 home cameras from ANYWHERE on my cell phone or lap top! It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!! You just scan the bar code symbol and poof, like magic you can see all of your cameras. I give the total package a 9 out of 10. I DO recommend this system.","Shoe is okay loose fit, somewhat comfortable.","It tastes like it hasn\u2019t been sifted. Other brands taste cleaner and better. I can hardly stomach this. Great benefits to my body but it gags me.","One if pictures shown in advertisements shows an ink pad. I assumed it came with it. I didn't. Now I am driving all over town trying to find a green ink pad.","I never received my order. I reached out to the company twice with no response. Very poor customer service.","I haven\u2019t had my Apple Watch protective case that I purchased seems to be fine. I haven\u2019t had it very long. But, so far no complaints.","Perfect fit, nice design, good quality for the price :-)","Came well packaged. Super easy to use. Love how big the caps are. But no recipe book! Don\u2019t advertise it if you aren\u2019t going to send it!! I kind of want a few bucks back just for misleading me!","Fit over my 8mm wires with 90 degree boots on each end. They did however turn black when only slightly touching headers....","Professionally built I\u2019ll be mounting tomorrow.","Worthless, tech support does not even answer back. Not working. Do not buy.","Easy to carry around, set up and fold up. It takes less than 2 min to set it up. Now i don't need to carry those heavy umbrella and chairs to the beach.","there was too much shifting scenes to follow the individual chapters.","This made a nice addition to the wrestling theme of my Grandson's Easter basket!","Does not work at all. Came and does not look like the picture. Fits my husband did not even try on any of my kids as where you would hook up the medicine cup is positioned very wrong.","I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery\u2019s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.","The taste is strange, Stick with the orange mango","The ball appears to be durable but the pump is tedious. It is a plastic hand pump and it is difficult to pup enough air to make it full and then quickly remove the pump and insert the stopper. An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.","It looks nice but it is only facial quality. The rubber tips bend very easily. The wood is cheap wood. And the molly screws broke in my wall and made gigantic holes. So now I have to spackle, paint and redo the whole process which should have been 5 min to do. The molly screws they give are cheap and are WAY too big. Use your own tools for this and you should be fine and it will look nice.","I would not recommend buying if you have narrow feet.","I received two wraps and both are latex free. The description says contains latex. They are not nearly as sticky as the latex versions. Beware!","Package was delivered to wrong address. My neighbor brought it to me.","I have wanted a pair of Penny Loafers for a long time. Haven't worn them since High School but have had my eye on them for a while. Great quality and fit. One of my favorite purchases.","Works super well. Also works great for other tough cleaning jobs like dried up flour/dough.","I don't really like this aloe gel. I don't like how it smells and texture (very liquid, no like a gel).","Cheesey, so much internal dialogue it bacame whiny, and when she tried to stand up to her father she sounded like a whiny child, she admits it, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant to read. Oh, the cheesey parts were with the cult, too ridiculous to be funny.","It works and the mirror flip is great!","Why doesn't everyone have these!!!??? THEY ARE AWESOME!!","This is what you will get ,it s nothing like the photos they have Very disappointed and I don't know how Amazon can back up like those people never order from them check my photos and compare I through it in the trash","Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it\u2019s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn\u2019t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.","Great Product Great Seller","Never received the item","The laces could have been better quality","Used it on my Mahogany kitchen counter and it really made it dull and didnt seem to leave much of a protective coat vs other Tung oils Ive used.","I stuck this on my friend's car. Its a clean cut! very nice","Bought as a gift, but didnt work. By the time given, return window passed.

Easy reading when you just want a break from everyday life.","Easy to use and install Works well in diffusing light I use it with a Nikon speed flash and it gives me nice options for controlling light especially with portraits.

Got this for an arts and crafts table.","Pen is really small and uncomfortable and there aren't any other options available for this tablet. I need a small tablet to do remote work in cafes etc. and the Pro model, even the small one, is WAY to big. Going to return and try a Huion I guess.","Nice coloring book except the pages are not in numerical order and are placed in the book to where some of the mandala's are on the right page, others on the left and in some places both left and right pages are blank. But for the price it works for what it was purchased for - quiet time of coloring.","They are boxers that fit,and the cover as they are supposed to. Ne'er vice was excellent!","Got it for my wife. She had supply issues. This helped her to boost supply. We buy 1 every month. Good Stuff!!","Lots of items and options for the price, seems to work well.","Great quality for the price. If you know how to convert them to HID even better.","They smell weird, and are very thin. But I got them for our arch. Hoping they are going to work. Won't know till o go check with the venue. Nice for the price tho.","It was a small medium I'd say. Go a size up for baggier fit.","We got this for my son who loves to look at bugs. This is a great magnifying glass for little kids as it is solid and has a soft grip so little hands wont drop it.","Handy bag. Fits ladies' shoes easily and also able to fit large men's shoes.","I never received the darn thing","Using this product to spread acrylic paint on my canvas","the instructions that came with it were terrible","Great condition, great movie! Disc wasn\u2019t scratched at all, and the box was perfect.","I bought the kitchen shears for preparing chicken for Asian dishes. We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.","My daughter really likes the design and colors on this product. It\u2019s easy to hole and drink from. However, it seems to get too much air inside of it- tons of air bubbles. I also don\u2019t like how water gets trapped between the bottle and the handles. If I had a you get child, I wouldn\u2019t use it at all because of all of the air it takes in.","Product was available very quickly. Very nice color. Thinner than I expected.","Quality is not good.","A more than impressive manual. Bought it to learn the fundamentals of Powershell for my job needs and it definitely helped me master the basics through lots of examples and clear explanations. If you're looking to master PS this guide is worth buying","the panels open up sideways making it almost impossible to frame around it, very disappointed.","This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren\u2019t really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn\u2019t be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!","The story capture my attention and the tempo of the story is well organized.","Nice comfortable shoe. Does have wiggle room but, unfortunately, so does the heel. The straps err on the side of too much give which makes the shoe bed too loose. Sad to say but they must be returned. Bye bye cool shoe...","The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.","When I bought this last week I didn't realize it is a \"kit\" which you have to put together yourself. I thought the product was ready to use upon opening the package. That being said, I still haven't used this product and I am thinking of sending it back.","The rings are very bulky and dig into my toes. I can't really wear them while walking around.","Two of 3 units failed within a few weeks on the carriage lights on my garage.","I installed the fan (Second one ordered) and I had to start it with my finger, as it would only move a couple of CMs when first powered up. After turning the blade with my finger and letting it run for an hour, it would then start by itself. It does not instill a feeling of confidence in the product. Their fans are usually top quality.","It's soft and the price was good, but for this particular pillow pet (butterfly), it came apart at a seam during only the 2nd wash and got fuzz EVERYWHERE in our washer (and eventually the dryer as all the clothes covered in fuzz dried out). I stitched it together so we'll see how it goes. If this was my first experience it would be 1 star... but 3 stars because this size pillow pet is great for my daughter at preschool and the unicorn we previously had held up for two years of constant use and washing before it finally got lost/stolen.","no good did not fit, I cut ir a bit to make it fir . worked ok for about 3 day and everything was gone","Sorry! This does not work! Can I send it back? It is useless!","Watery texture. Immediately caused severe itching upon first application. I had to wash it off after 5 minutes.","Never delivered they refunded the money though","Nice and light to wear for summer.","Cheap quality. Break easily","My dentist recommended these tuft brushes to help clean the deep grooves in my chewing teeth (molars). Most regular toothbrushes and even electric tooth brushes do not reach deep enough, which led me to have lots of cavities. It also is great for reaching behind my back most teeth. I use both regular tooth brushes and this brush to clean my deep grooved molars. So glad I found these in economic 3 packs, so worth it...","I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.","There are some reason for 5 stars: -- It's small and lightweight, easy to carry anywhere bcs of it's retractable design. -- Only one cord I need when indeed in charging bcs of it's 3-in-1 design. -- Must value of money there as received 2pcs in one package. -- Fast charge and data sync as there are no any difference in charge and transfer data with my original cord. -- Promptly arrived as arrived within one week. All in one, good quality and convenient.","This cover fits my CharBroil grill but its loose and sloppy. The fabric is very flimsy unlike my previous grill cover which was stiffer and held its shape. this one touches the ground when its on the grill and leaves dirty marks on the top of the grill which i dont know if they will come off now.","A dislike it being all crust open the only thing I like that you had plastic secured to secured on the inside but I'm not happy","Love this stand. I am a teacher (computers) so I need to be moving around the classroom while demonstrating with a projector. So my laptop needs to move with me. This has a shelf for the remote &amp; even storage on the bottom.","So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.","Ordered these as stocking stuffers, but 3 of the figures are poorly made (i.e. have scratches, incomplete painting, etc.) Luckily I only need 8, but 75% is not a good record.","iOttie has created better cell Phone holders in the past. This one does not stay on air vent wing and keeps sleeping off while driving for prolonged periods. On top of that shipping was delayed extensively even though it stated it was in stock and was considered a Prime Benefit item. On the plus side it does hold the iPhoneX with an Otter Defense box.","the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.","Really disappointed with what I received. The label says it is compatible with the Bialetti Mini Express. The gasket I have is on it\u2019s absolute last leg. The pictures above show the size differences.

He says this machine is suitable and perfect for everyday use this summer, he surprised at how quickly it started to make ice cubes.","So I purchased this thing in May (2018) and used it maybe 3 times since purchase. Well today I needed it and had it set for 51 inch lbs. On the 2nd bolt it 'popped' and the ratchet now spins free. Complete waste of money. \"get what you pay for\" is totally accurate in this case. Stay AWAY.","Received Bathtub Drain Hole Hair Catcher Drain. Can't return with the policy on this item. Please be aware!","It was a trial for me. Not really my type of book. I would read others.

It turned on but the motor was completely dead","Supposedly NO STAR! The fibers are spreading all over my polo shirt. Very low quality of fabric looks untidy.","It's small and a little difficult to read. I would have liked larger text.","These cards don't make sense. The \"Thank you\" has nothing to do with the cartoons on the cards. Several of the cards were misprinted and the cartoon was cut off. I returned them as a result. I'm glad they were misprinted so that I didn't have to keep them. Because of the cartoons, they should be blank inside, not say \"Thank You\"","These silicone straws are amazing!! I got one for me and my son. I love how they have their own carrying case and cleaning brush for on the go. I take it with me everywhere and use it with all my drinks. I am so glad I found these straws.","If I could give this 0 stars I would. When I received this, it came with 1/4 full only.

It works much better after using this product.","I had bought this in Oct 2016, by mid 2017, they had already become quite soft, and by end of 2017, they had almost flattened.. Certainly not worth the current price.","Poor support, back portion dug into my achilles heel tendon","It installs easy. Kit includes everything. Works with no leaks. Just know that the blast stream is definitely tight and concentrated. So much so that if you turn the pressure too far you could potentially hurt yourself. I recommend turning the control dial slowly up to the point it is going to get uncomfortable. You could use a sharpy to mark where is the \"sweet spot\" pressure point is. A couple other tips are: 1. Use paper to wipe off the initial heavy. 2. Check your wash job with a clean piece of paper to make sure you got it all.","Never even received them so I can\u2019t tell if they are worth your time or not... they weren\u2019t anything but a WASTE of my time since they never showed and we needed them for our daughter\u2019s haunted maze that she put on for the neighborhood kids on Halloween... \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","Well made product and the little magnet was pure genius.

Got it for my 11 year old daughter, she sure loves it. I will update the post if anything goes wrong. But I really don\u2019t expect it cause it seems pretty good quality and i am really pleased with the price too.","Very nice knife for less than$ 10.00 !","I've been using Guitars for a while and while this model looked good initially, it deteriorated very quickly there after. Only after 1 month of light-use (2-3 hours a week), it started degrading. The grip of the strings started to loosen up and no matter how many times you tighten it up it always loosens immediately on playing and causing a weird tone while strumming. That is not how a good guitar should function!","Definitely recommend. Great to have back ups for my kids ipads. I have been used a lots of cables, This is my favorite. General line is too short, I like to lay on bed playing with mobile phone when charging, Always bent. This line solves this problem. Very convenient. And the quality is also very good! Excellent quality cable at a very good price. Great purchase. Arrived quickly &amp; works as expected.","The boar bristle brush is so well made. The quality exceeded my expectations. The comb, travel bag and head band were a perfect touch. Thank you !","Ever since I got this phone, I\u2019ve had nothing but trouble in activating the phone. Apparently, the SIM card I received was compatible with Verizon which is not my carrier. After giving me the run around, I was told I needed to buy a T-mobil SIM card. I couldn\u2019t find one locally so I ordered it from Amazon. Two days later, I called Tracfone back to finally activate my new phone and was informed that this new SIM card was still no good. This time around they offered to send me one free of charge. Now, it\u2019s a week later and I have a phone I can\u2019t use. Grrrr..... I can\u2019t understand why Tracfone doesn\u2019t ask you which network is compatible with you phone and send you the correct SIM card BEFORE shipping the phone. My hope is that I\u2019ll receive the correct SIM and get my phone activated once and for all. Otherwise, I\u2019ll send it back.","Item was way to Small","As described. Fast service.","Bought the pedal exerciser for my 87 yr old mother. She loves it and although she is active - even still mows her own lawn, she likes using it when she is inside when the weather is rainy or cool. She liked the fact it was assembled except for the tension knob so she was able to use it right out of the box.","I like the clear cup because it allows you to see the tea strength and I loved the top because it holds the tea bag and it can be used to drain the liquid out of the tea bag. However after the 3rd time I used the tea cup tea leaked into the lining of the cup and can no longer be used, very disappointing.","Second one for second vehicle. First one works fine. Item is a bit pricey but there is no arguing the external quality. The longevity of the circuits only time will tell","My husband loves this product!","When I charge two of the same type of device but use different cables, the Native Union cable takes 3 times as long to charge the same item with approximately the same amount of battery life remaining. I contacted the seller and they never replied. Do not recommend purchase of this item. I have a similar style by another manufacturer and it still works like a champ 4 years later.","fairly sturdy. dip bar a little high.","More of a dress than a tunic. Not built for rapid walking.","Sizing chart was inaccurate. Too large for my child and also very wide in general. They threw in surprise arm floaties, so that was nice..... just would have rather had a proper fighting jacket and no floaties. Took a long time to ship.","Package was opened and delivered with bashed in packaging.","Can't tell you if this item is good because it never showed up! Already 4 day past delivery date and had to get other ones before the game. Contacted seller and gave excuses and gave me a tracking link that goes nowhere.","you have to make sure the zipper is in the correct direction or you end up not locking the bag. However, when you get used to that it is good.","If the stakes are wooden. These things are like dull saw blades ripping their way through the meat. NOT sharp. Returned and very disappointed. Handles are nice. Know that these are made in China.","This box is nice looking, but it's not very functional. Once you get halfway through the box of tissues, it becomes very difficult to access the remaining ones. Much more decorative than it is function for sure.","We bought 4 packs of 10. They are cute! Shipping was quick. However, I'm a little disappointed as to each pack has 50% with the same images, and 1 pack has only 1 pink and the rest are blue. These are how they were packed, and I just put all the faces up to show.","Not sure what was wrong with this moisturizer but since I started using this moisturizer, my face was more oily than it was before and I seen more pimple pop up. After a week of using this, I throw it away. This does seem to be a good moisturizer but maybe it is not for my face type.","Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.","So I bought this fan for a trip to europe which I'm leaving for tomorrow. Lots of the places I'll be staying there won't have air conditioning so I thought this little fan would be the perfect thing. I don't know if the fan I received is defective or what. I put in brand new batteries and could hardly feel any air coming out even with the stupid thing three inches from my face. Then when I tried to take out the batteries, the plastic cover broke and a little metal piece fell off of the battery holder. Seriously don't buy this fan, I'm warning you. You'll just have to throw it away and go out last minute to find one that works!","Unit works good in grass, age appropriate, easy to operate. Design flaw...Have to unscrew battery compartment disconnect low quality connector which will break with repeated use, pull out battery pack to recharge. Unit is slightly overpriced for this reason, otherwise new out of box has been fun. Hopefully it will last, but not confident with connection for battery.","We've been using this to treat IBS and leaky gut, as well as get gut flora back into optimal range after years of medications. Over time we have noticed a huge improvement in regularity and cramps. Very much worth trying!","I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..","The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.","Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged","Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these. They are completely secure. It took a little practice to remove them (use your fingers, not your fingernails, and practice a few times before you put them on) but they are great.","My 4 year old loves MARIO and the adjustability is good, ranges to fit anyone head comfortably. Would purchase again.","Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.","I\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house! Picture of front door where it was left is not our front door?!?!","Easy to use and lightweight","Its a good computer but i had a defective battery that was not detecting!!!","Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.","Just got this yesterday, love it. Put it in air fluff dryer with 3 tennis balls. Did not want to wash right away as others suggest. This bag has better loft than a custom made Top Quilt I bought. Love the colors. Love that head and foot ends cinch up. I close the foot end and use as top quilt. Had a slight odor. I put a dryer sheet in hammock with bag. All good now. This was shipped UPS and they left package at another house. UPS did not follow up with their investigation of where package delivered; so I had to go hunting for it all over neighborhood. Love the USPS. UPS, I have had problems. Just an FYI.","Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.","Hard to use for my 5 &amp; 3 year old. They know how to work FaceTime easily but this app is a little more difficult","Only giving 3 starts because it\u2019s not very sturdy it kind of wiggles when you move it, but if you leave it alone, it\u2019s works very well and very cute. Tool me about 30 minutes to install by myself.","Very thin and even more fragile. The only good thing about them is that they were definitely strong.","Woohoo now this story just throw me for a whole new meaning of being daddy's little girl I for once don't want to mess with Daddy he is just so over the top of a lovely papa that I want one of my own.

HIGHLY recommend!","My family and I love these. When I received these, I was wondering why they were in baggies, and not packaged like the picture on Amazon. It looked like they were opened and they put them in the baggies to sell them. Oh well, I am not sure that I will order these again.","I looked around for a few weeks for a GOOD tongue jack for my enclosed trailer. I finally settled on this one which was one of the most expensive ones out there. I don\u2019t mind paying for quality. After opening and installing this jack it worked for about 10 seconds and then quit. It didn\u2019t even let all the way down to the ground before burning up. I do not recommend this jack to anyone. Buy a cheap one and take your chances.","This worked out really well for me. I was consistently getting 90 pumps or water out of the 5 ml size bottle. That is not a typo. Ninety.","I didn't order a case for a iPhone I don't have that phone","Thrilled that it has no aluminum, but does nothing to prevent underarm body odor after sweating.","They're okay but the light swath could be much wider. A little disappointed.","It does not secure to your ear once you start sweating in the gym or especially running. Do not buy this garbage.","Sleek design, very light. Love it.","Didn\u2019t have much luck using them.","Too big for my wrist! (I\u2019m female, early 30s, 5.5\u201d and average body complexity). And it is also too big for my mom\u2019s wrist. I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don\u2019t offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.","These earrings are darling and so lightweight! They go with so many different outfits and are just the right size! I absolutely love them!","gift receiver really pleased","My sensory child hates flavored toothpaste. This really has zero flavor and smell. It foams up a tiny bit, if this is an issue, so I had to run the toothpaste under a little water for my kid.","These candles burn nicely and do not drip. They are also very pale and do not smell like beeswax or at least the ones I get from my local Farmer's Market. My Bee Guy's candles are also cheaper and burn a little longer.","Works well, it's not very sturdy, but handle carefully. So far, no problems but I clamp the heater lightly.","The mirrors are very good and fit nicely, however installation is very challenging due to the difficult location of the bolts and nuts. Also the instructions are a pathetic excuse and virtually unusable. Find a YouTube video to see how to actually mount the mirrors. K","Very cheap craftsmanship. Poor sewing and flimsy materials. Returning immediately as it will probably quickly fall apart it's made so poorly. I'll spend a little more money to get something that is well built and will last.","Good bowls, but wish they were bigger. Also wish they would just slide in and out easier - every time I put the water one back in I would slop water as it was hard to click it without doing so.","I did a lot of shopping around and decided on this light because it was the cheapest of the ones with the features I wanted.

Too many pages that don't have any kind of meaning for me. The very last page had a small drawing I enlarged and copied. The intricate drawing is what I like about Celtic drawings. This one doesn't add up. Sorry but not again.","Fell apart after ~2 months of use.","This model do not have a GPS connection, also the time on the watch delayed 10 minutes. The menu Is not easy or simple to operate.","I pre ordered this book because I really like the first few books. This one however is a total let down. This is a fictional story and the trashy political jabs should have been left out. The story would be just fine without the author interjecting her personal political views.

Surface scratched. Will be returning!","I ordered this product a size larger than I normally wear and it was snug. 2 sizes larger would probably have fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. These are easily dressed up for work or to be made more casual.. very versatile","Works great around your nails for clean up. If you use it as a base to keep your nails from being damaged it takes forever to dry.","This works exactly as described. Make sure the seat is tightly secured before putting your child in it.","O.K. for the price. Not so sturdy. Was broken in the first 2 days.","My Crested loves these. He only eats the chicken off but a good treat for him.","In the picture it appears longer. The material is cheap as well.","VERY good. I would buy Again","Installed easily but only lights up if faucet is turned in maximum.","The quality and concept of this product is excellent. So much better than the dial ones, cleaner and less awkward to use. The only difficulty I have is the length the bar extends can be a little can be dangerous when doing skull crushers.","This is the first book in a new series and is set in a small town in Colorado. The main character,. Cassie Collins had been away from her home town for many years and returns home after a bad car accident. She reunites with her best friend, who happens to be a deputy. There is a murder that is very similar to ne that happened 20 years ago and Cassie helps investigate. Well-written and very enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing where this series goes!","rental book in very bad shape","Lovely wooden cover. Well made and very slim. Fits my iPhone 8 Plus well. Would have liked it a bit more snug though. There\u2019s no raised lip on the front to protect the screen so having a full glass screen protector is highly recommended.","Me an my sone loves doing these together!","Not worth your time it is to short and clogged way to easily.","I\u2019ve bought this before with no issue. However, this time they arrived unusable. Totally smashed, but the box was fine. Seems they are sending out defective product. Difficult to see by the picture because it\u2019s such a small item size. Buyer beware. Hoping to hear from the seller, but you know how that goes!","Cookie mix sticks to mold. Then when cookies cook, design disappears. I bought 2 sets, received another for Christmas. I like the cookie press kit lots better. You squeeze the cookie dough through a syringe with a decorative design.","I hope that it lasts longer than the last shoulder bag I purchased!","this product is not up to par. used it for a month, broke, seller did send another one, but used it for a month, and it broke as well. now seller won't send me another.","Feels very heavy and blocks your pores, will not be buying this product again.","This is very similar to the instrument that my doctor uses. They do offer an app to log results which I found extremely difficult to install....I am technically challenged...","These are great! I was going to separate the duplicate pages then discovered there are no duplicate pages!","The flavor is disgusting. I had to stop taking it however, it does work. The taste is just not right.","I enjoyed this book immensely. If you want to figure out how to deal with liberal extremists who continually call you names- this is the book you have to read.","This is just another replacement port that ruins the receiving ability of the phone. Don't worry all 3 different ones I purchased are the same as well. I cleaned the debris I finally found in the old port and the recieving ability is as good as new and the port charges as well. The port you sell is not usable and should not be sold.","Looks like in the picture. It protects my laptop very well. Keep in mind that you won\u2019t be able to use the tablet mode. It\u2019s a great product, however, you can\u2019t increase the degree between keyboard and screen more than 45-50 degrees or the laptop will tilt back a little due to the weight.","Works great easy to use.","Gray remains beautiful. It would have been a better movie had her role been larger. Actually, it would have been a better movie had anything at all been done differently.","4.5 Stars for Lie With Me I love the Stonewall Investigation series and have from the very beginning. I was so glad that author Max Walker didn't stop the series but opened up more offices across the nation and spending time in Miami with the boys. Loved Oliver and Beckham together. I have to say I was shocked at the twist at the end, for the life of me never expected it. That's what I enjoy about reading a Max Walker book, the suspense, mystery and the romance. This is the trifecta for a good read!","Smells wonderful!! Lasts for hours.","I bought a pair of these back in August and have been using them every day at work. They make a world of difference for me, and if I forget them at home one day my eyes really feel it. Most people in the office thought they were real, prescription glasses and were surprised to find out I got them off Amazon purely for staring at the computer screen. I've never had an issue with the quality or anything like that. I'm actually planning on buying another pair to keep at home.","I ordered a size 8 and it fitted true to size. The shoe is cute and very light. The rubber soles are nice for walking around the office. It has minimal cushion support, I suggest getting an insert if you plan on being on your feet for a couple hours.","Works great for walls but a little too big for door frames!","You cannot call out side intercoms. Someone has to ring door bell. My issue is i\u2019ve had two unwelcome visitors that I would have liked to communicate before they broke into vehicles. I don\u2019 Know any criminals that will ring door bell first .","Bought this for my teenager and it is way too big. This would fit a Large head.","These are very comfortable, fit well, and don't slip or slide on the floors.","Product did not work out of the box. The wiring was loose and after fixing the loose wiring, product would work during the test but when installed in the ceiling, no response. Tried 3 times to make it work and finally had to go to local Home Depot and buy another fan which worked right away. Trying to return the product to Amazon.","Instead of a pack of 6 bags 40\" long, I was sent one bag 47\" long!","large might fit to size 8 1/2","Not the color I was expecting","I loved the clock really nice but arrived with one of the points broken. Tried to get issue resolved no help from seller. Loved the clock very unique.giving it a one because seller won't get back to me.","Product arrived warped, in turn didn\u2019t function as intended. Would consider something different.","Perfect for traveling - enough room for phone, credit cards and money!","The kit is almost what you need for the nintendo switch except it has no long handled tweezers and that is a must when working on the small circuit boards and electrical ribbons. If looking for a set for your nintendo pass this one up and get one with tweezers","I love the shoes - they are super comfortable. I ordered a size 8 Wide (which I sometimes wear along with size 8) because they didn\u2019t have size 8 and it is a little too big, but I\u2019m going to keep them since I already wore them.","I really love this walker! The only thing I would warn people about is that it does not work on carpet.","Came as described. Quick shipping and daughter loves it","Love the reinforcement edges, just as pretty in person, and the tabs and pages are usable! I think this calendar will work! I do wish it had more note pages and the ability to add pockets (has one) to the binder. It's a go though!","I was so excited to get this rug cause it looked more plush and fluffy than other rugs I\u2019ve seen. This, however, wasn\u2019t the case. It is indeed a very pretty rug but not as soft as I hoped and unfortunately to me, doesn\u2019t have a good feel to it either.","While the box is solid and arrived promptly there was nothing either to attached or already to installed that allows you to hang the files. You know, the reason why I purchased the box","A fun D.D. Warren short story. The problem with short stories is I always want more. Love Lisa Gardner. Enjoy.","RETIRE BEFORE TWENTY-NINE is the great book. i love this book . this book is the great book. i like this book. thanks author.","Very nice sign, love it","It tastes so good. I love putting it in protein shakes but it is really good to mix with water and put on toast.","Quite possibly the ugliest glasses I've ever bought. I returned them because they offered no protection from sunlight.","One didn\u2019t work so sending both back","The rose design is beautiful and it feels great when holding the case, because it's really smooth. But, the quality of the case is subpar. The corners of the case was not properly glued on so the plastic is sticking out and could possibly come off with normal wear and tear. Would not really recommend this case for long term use.","Should furnish Google's. Dangerous to face.","Probably the longest wearing polish I\u2019ve ever tried. Lasts more than 2 weeks on my toes. No chips ! Love it.","As a beginning of a longer story- a bit disappointing. Extremely religious world, the whole gods system unclear, military fractions mixed up. So, the commander of knights , experienced soldier, during many skirmishes and war didn\u2019t kill anyone? Nonsense. The plague concept interesting, let\u2019s see how the author develops it. Dead who are alive - difficult concept, we can\u2019t be even sure who is in and out, for the whole series a threat, as there might be the case, that those killed in the first volume will be back in the third. I\u2019ll buy the second book anyway to see , where it goes.","The mirror was nice but arrived damaged. I couldn't plug the usb cord into the base because the hole was misaligned. returned it for that reason and ordered a different one.","I have fat calves so I ordered a size larger than I needed to accommodate. I don't want to say that the item is somewhat small for that reason. I was well aware that that could be an issue for me. However, I was able to get my fat calves in them with a little work and am largely comfortable in them.","These are really pretty but smaller than I expected. Package next to a roku remote for perspective.","Awe man I really feel bad for writing a poor rewrite as I see some people have really enjoyed this record player. I got it and out of the box I had issues with the tune arm. I could not get it to stop skipping! Every record I tried I couldn\u2019t get the thing balanced, aside from that the speaker quality was worse than a tin can. I\u2019m so disappointed with this experience. I traded this in for an audio technica and the sound quality is night and day, no skipping! Perfectly clear sound from new records as it should be.","Great vinyl, just wish there wasn't a sticker holding it together. The vinyl itself is perfect for projects.","I received this item and was quite pleased with it. I would not hesitate to purchase another.","It is too sharp but its haft was been flaky after just a month.","It\u2019s just ok for me. I bought it because I thought the towel will dry my wet hair and I don\u2019t need to use hairdryer anymore. Well, I still need to use hairdryer to completely dry my hair.","It's very easy to put on and is comfortable to wear. I just wish I could pull it a little tighter in order to possibly speed up the process.","I am very pleased with the camera, it was easy to install and connecting to the network was simple. I use it to keep an eye on our pets outside and it has been reliable and I have had no problem connecting to it from my iphone","perfect for meal replacement shakes - a little thicker than regular straws but not too thick.","I knocked this tape down 2 stars because it doesn't stick to my skin very well. I have to wrap my thumbs a few times to get it to stick and then during my workout it rolls over itself or loosens more. I really like how flexible the tape is but wish it would stick better.","Not impressed by photo selection. Image quality is generally poor. Anybody can muse on someone else\u2019s photos.","So a dead battery 4 months in.... I have watches that are 5+ years running on the same battery, and this thing couldn't make it 1/2 a year. They should run for at least a year or they should be replaced free of charge.","This book caused me to do as lot of introspection and make quite a few adjustments. EXTREMELY instrumental in freeing up my time and allowing me to focus on the important an not the urgent.","Tug of war, just chewing, and fetch are the usual activities the tire is used for. Likes it better than his puppy kong.","Smaller than it looks","I usually wear 7.5 but I order 8w and it is small","Faster than expected delivery and exactly as ordered! Would definitely use this seller again!","Length is perfect but the sizing is so inconsistent! I bought two pairs to try on, 26, and 27. But the 27 is tighter than 26! And it\u2019s literally an inch smaller...","My husband really wanted this book. I looked and found it here at a great price. He's very happy with it.","I got this for my 4 year old can be a little slow at charging but she loves it good price good product","Excellent all around seasoning.....love it on everything I make.","Love them. Exactly what I needed. Highly recommend...","We ordered 5 boxes and got a wad of vacuum bags stuffed into a USPS envelope that was literally bursting at the seams.","Grandson loved it had great time at party","It does the job of coping the slides to the chip but it's a laborious process. Each slide has to be inserted into a holder and then inserted in the viewer. We hooked it up to the TV so we could both view the slide without having to look over each others shoulder. That went well, as long you have an extra HDMI port on your TV. The quality color is adequate for most slides, but if the slide has poor exposure, this device will only make it worst. The left to right and top to bottom buttons work well and are convenient.","I bought these for my grandsons! They love them!","My musical tree came with no music box and no blanket. Description says otherwise. Waiting on replacement.","The s-pen that it came with didn't work so I had to order a new one.","smells great and my heels are smoother","I bought this because I needed a small soft sided cooler that did not leak. It does that well enough thanks to the hard plastic liner. I've used it once a week for the past 3 weeks. It already has some damage because the zipper tends to get stuck on the flexible inner liner. It does not hold ice overnight.","Beautiful statue. Didn't ship with the legs.","Product arrived damaged the entire case was completely cracked and smashed in though this isn\u2019t the sellers fault it wasn\u2019t the greatest experience especially after I found out I could have purchased this for the same price at my local Best Buy","The ring holder is gorgeous to look at but not very functional. The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings. I also didn't realize how challenging it would be to grab silver jewelry from a silver tray. Glass ring holders are easier for this reason. Still, it's really beautiful to look at.","I use them strictly for walking every morning so it's a bit too early for an honest review. So far so good. Good fit and all.","Went together quite easily. Perfect size. Shelves a little flimsy, but they'll work.","The new recipe is disgusting. I have been buying these for 7 years and will never again. Chalky, artificial tasting. Please go back to the original recipe","Too small for most cell phones","is wrong one for my vehicle but yet I can't return it and get a refund due to I have to pay shipping back for returning product and be charged return shipping fees what good does that do me to return it when will cost almost same as if I just kept the thing ate the loss....","Started to work in minutes...i could see the fleas fall off my cat.","I was excited and they seemed nice (though I meant to order something much smaller), but then I pulled the bottom container off and the edge was cracked and broken.","I loved this necklace and got a TON of compliments on it! However, after owning it for less than 2 months, it broke. The tassel part broke off where it is soldered to the ring. I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful piece of jewelry and so versatile! I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.","120 Quart cooler is pretty big. The picture shows 3 stainless hinges and the product I received TWICE only has 2. I do not believe that 2 hinges will keep the lid from warping or the seal required so I returned them. The price is good and the Amazon service was good, but the picture does not accurately reflect the product shipped.","Tastes like burnt french fries. I don't recommend. I wouldn't buy, they are hard and taste like burnt cheese. The also arrived in pieces and crumbled, hardly any actual squares.","We have a select number king split bed. I'm not happy with this bed bridge because it's not very wide. We can't strap our mattresses together because each side is operated individually. The bridge falls into the split in the middle which then doesn't really serve the purpose its supposed to. I guess its better than nothing.","Is working just like it said my wort is slowly disappearing","This is a very thin protective case with a VERY thin bumper cover. Disappointed with purchase","I bought 2 pairs of these pants and they are great! Very comfortable and they fit very well in all the right places.","My friend is a Great Baker and loves horror movies. When I saw this apron I just had to get it. Of course he loves it.","This is a stunning table and perfect for spring and summer patio furniture. Everything folds to store in the garage during the winter. The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people. Giving it 4 stars because it was a total pain in the rear to put together, and the instructions were awful (no words, and minimal photos). If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.","Bought this as a gift and immediately gave it to my mom because we were so excited. Was I embarrassed. The hammock itself was okay so far after inspection, but all the straps and extra cords were tethered already. We couldnt even set it up because they looked so badly worn already. Now we have to order new straps and get some new cords to hold the net up.","I wish this was on a watch list for all teenagers. Gripping moving and so real. I was totally moved by thhis film.","Arrived promptly, all printed info correct. Unable to figure out how to adjust to fit wrist. Returned and given prompt, no hassle refund.","The Carburetor matched up fine for the motor. The throttle and choke arms were not installed, and would not connect to the existing links. I had to use the old arms to make it work. At the same time the Pressure washer now is always at full throttle and will not idle down.","Very nice pair of reading glasses. They came packaged in a sturdy box and the lenses were wrapped in a cling type plastic. They hold exceptionally well when looking straight down. They don\u2019t squeeze your head and the rubber grips on the earpiece really help keep them in place. I will buy these again when it\u2019s time.","Received a larger size than what I originally ordered. Too big in the chest area.","Construction quality seems good, but i do not always get sugar out of it when dispenser is tipped over. Unfortunately, i am shopping for a traditional dispenser now.","Got it tried to charge it and it didnt work","If you're a Perry fan, this is a killer CD. The harmonies on 'You Better Wait' are IN-sane. There's a lot of heart and soul poured into this album....from the poignant 'Missing You', to his implied apology to former Journey bandmates in 'Anyway'. Definitely recommend this CD!","Love the comfort of these!!","But for my dogs 30 and 50 pounds they need the bigger size. they ate this not chew.","Had to seal the lens gaps in several places that water was passing through","Sensivity of the tablet is not high enough. It works fine otherwise.","This was a huge disappointment! I ordered it for my daughter to take when she moved to NYC. We knew it would be a little while before she could get a real bed and wanted her to be able to use this in the meantime. It did not fully inflate nor did it hold air!","I didn't like the product that much","Was a good product until one of the bands just broke only had a few days","Excellent. Nice big cleaning towel that works great.","Every now and then, I get cracked fingertips. I wash my hands a lot and, perhaps, don't apply lotion enough. These gloves are like magic! I put lotion on at bedtime and slip these on. In the morning - voila! My hands are nice and soft and the ends not sore and dry anymore. I look forward to using these into the wintertime and experiencing such relief!","Do not take the advice of other customers and order a size larger. Order your regular American size...","This has no problem pretty much gluing itself to the pergo floor, but no matter what type of rug I have tried, they all slide around on top of it which completely defeats the purpose. Waste of money.","I thought it was great.... until I found it was missing pages in April right when I needed to schedule my appointments! It only went up to April 13th then straight to May. Who knows if there are more pages missing. I wish I had noticed this when I could still return it. I suggest if you do buy this planner, go through EVERY MONTH and make sure there are no pages missing.","I bought the queen size and it hardly covers just past corners of bed, basically sits on top of mattress. Are you sure you sent a queen, the package says queen, but it's small.","It was broken when it arrived","Beautiful piece, in a nice felt bag with drawstring. Love it!","When I bought expensive furniture, the store recommended this polish. So did a friend who is an interior designer. I have now been using it on fine furniture for about 5 years. It does a nice job and does not leave build-up. Fairly expensive, so you might want to use it on just the good stuff.","It does exactly what I wanted like a deep tissue massage... Very happy 5 Stars....","The charger port cover doesn't fit into the port","The plastic on this product is to soft on the hook area and has no hold for any object that you hang with it.","The shoes were priced low for a reason, the shoes barely lasted a month.","I like smelling and the safety even my bichon Ari lick it it doesn't harm to her but I don't think her facial became really white though. My puppy doesn't have tear stain anyways. I use it for my bichon ari's on face only.","order once just does not work for me .","The vibration is a bit loud but I like the spontaneous play at home or in public. The vibration speeds are average. Overall decent by if u r just looking for a little tease","I purchased these water bottles in 25oz green for travelling internationally. Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)","This is a very short movie, a kind of \"Who dunnit?\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)","Yes yes yes!!!! My daughter loves it and it is a great size!!!!!","I have had it for less than 2 months and water is sprinkling along the hose","The product was used with her new waffle maker","This pin is awesome! It's exactly what I was looking for.","Easy to put up and work great.","Not quite like frying in oil but without the mess and expense of oil. Certainly healthier. But be prepared to adjust your recipes and taste, and you will be thrilled with results. I returned an oil fryer and got this instead. Much happier with this large greaseless device that is more like a baker than a fryer.","I like the community sprite, continued peeks into the family of Bliss. Great to see the new plot unfold. It never appears as you would expect.","I never received the product. Delivered to the wrong address. And there's no way to contact the seller. Don't buy this.","I bought these for my daughter last year, the addition and subtraction were great! But I just pulled the multiplication out to start and half the cards are missing or duplicates. For example, there are three 5x10 cards in a row but no other 5 multiplication tables. Really dissapointed, because I can no longer return.","I think this is much clearer than the projector I bought before I like this very much","Froth made quickly using cold or warm half and half. No place to store both mixers in handle.","Just like every charger I've ever bought, they only fast charge for the first few weeks.","This was a gift for a friend, and he loves it! He sends me a picture every time he uses it and it is so cute!","Perfect for me....but i received broke on one wrist side. Send this back ask for return nerver receive return back..very disappoint...","This case is okay. I does protect my tablet. The body seems well made and not flimsy. There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus. The case fits my Fire HD 8 Tablet, but the inside 'frame' opening is off center, so one side of the tablet face is a bit covered and there isn't room inside the case to shift the table over.","Love at first sight! Amazing how quickly one can fall in love, across the room he sees her &amp; it's over from that point on. It's not easy, but a way is found! Jace &amp; Bethany find their way to forever after!","It's not wooden material which was misleading as when purchased, it wasn't written anywhere on the page stating the material and the caption was \"wood\". The steam is too weak to be used as humidifier. After 1 month using it, it gave a long beep sound when trying to turn on, after the beep it will not turn on so I have to unplug to reset it. This happens often.","Uncomfortable design, can never get it to fit just right. And after working in it a few hours it becomes almost unbearable. Might want to try the full back brace before this.","Product came missing hooks very disappointed","The foil piece doesn't work well at all. And for some reason one week after buying it i changes the head and it didnt work at all. Im very disappointed in this product.","don\u2019t care for the smell of the product","Glue and paint inside the pipe. That's a no from me, but at least it makes for a good prop.","Beautiful dress! I'm 5'7 and 140 pounds. I ordered a small for a tighter fit, but it was still a little loose.","too many items to check","I would have given this skirt 5 stars but both pockets had holes in them. Otherwise, nice fit (I am a size 10-12, ordered a Large) and great length.","Gloves look ok, but arrived defective on both hands","Looks ok considering the price. Started out so pretty, after less than a week of daily wearing, the metal turned copper color. Not enjoyable to wear. Save up your dollar bills for a nicer ring.","I love how the table feels with this on it!","It's exactly what is needed. Does what it's supposed to do.","Enjoyed the detectives. Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series","I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.","Sizes are not accurate","This item is only made of plastic. I have other ice packs that have a soft fabric on one side, eliminating the need to place a \"towel\" next to your skin, as instructed by this one. I wanted to return it, but was not allowed to.","The clip of this starter is terrible and seems like the wrong size most of the time. The entire assembly has fallen apart several times as the tube threading below the battery also seems too loose. The charger plug is simply a 1/8\u201d headphone jack with a hex soldered to it, which broke off after a few times and had to be resoldered after being cut apart. Really unimpressive quality overall - i doubt it will last.","My daughter bought this as pjs but also ended up wearing as a Halloween costume. She loves it!","I really like Tough Headwear's products but I was disappointed with my beige beanie. The beanie is not at all beige. At best, the color is a warm gray. I am satisfied with all of the other colors I ordered (light gray, pink, maroon, army green, dark gray, black, and white) and if I could give them all a separate rating, all would get a 5 out of 5 stars.","I was missing the letter D, which upset me very much! but I didn't want to give 1 star cause I was able to decorate using the other letters and it came out cute! They are really delicate! you have to insert the straw VERY CAREFULLY! 1 small tear ruins the balloons, obviously! :(","I kinda knew when I got this book that it was going to be a sweet romance, which honestly, is rarely my cup of tea. That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.","Had surgery recently and I learned some of the PT exercises. It meets the same standards as the ones provided at the gym.","Grandbaby loves them. Pefect for his size!","Nice case, but I can't use it. It does not fit my Samsung S6 Active. And it isn't returnable.","The stakes don't work in sand.","No it ripped the same day I got it , I want another one.","The design of the shirt feels very cheap. The lettering started cracking after being worn once.","If you're marketing a sports logo item the logo should at least be visible on the front of the item.","The top pouch is starting to come undone. Is there anything that can be done?","The robe is great. Good quality on the cloth itself. The horns are cheap, they don\u2019t hold up. And the cord was not included. If the cord was included I would have given one star more. Would have given 5 stars if everything was included and the horns were not cheap material.","They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.","Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.","Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.","Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel. I broke off a bolt inside the frame where the sway bar attached and had to weld a rivet nut to the frame. Just be aware when installing.","The fitting was not comfortable and the mask was heavy.","Nose-Pad Arm Breaks Easy. Where's The Guarantee. I liked the product but how does one return to ThinOptics without a hassle.","no suprises really, and multiple spelling errors. Good enough to finish, but easy enough to walk away from too. Glad it was a free book.","Car is amazing, assembly is complete. It is fast and flexible when driving. If you are looking for a fast and I mean fast racing style truck, this is it...... Come on! You would not want to missing it.","Some of these smell good and others smell kind of 'ok'. They cause a strong allergy response and causes my nose to burn and other times cause a headache. I stopped using them.","Seems like authentic ink!","Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime. Directions say to turn the top one way to open, but my bottle opens the other way. It took me 4 days trying to open the bottle until I tried the other way. I will probably purchase again.","fits a little loose around tops. but great colors","Not bad for a small assortment of flies for a fast trip, have to make sure there isn't any material protruding outside of the case.","Was able to get it to work once and then it never worked afterward. Shame nintendo is so greedy with their \"official\" dock.","We purchased these radios to use in our care facility for communication purposes and HIPPA compliance. This is the list of issues that my staff have reported: Lots of static, picking up conversations outside of our facility, very hard to hear, some of the ear pieces do not work (staff cannot hear through them) microphones not working, radio volume not working (can barely hear with some of them). Very hit and miss with these radios. Need something more reliable that works consistently.","I thought this was from DEe Zee. This is not Dee Zee. It is a cheap knock-off. The hydraulic arm is so tight it is now a nuisance to wait till the tailgate lowers. It even took my whole body weight and channel locks to pull it out long enough to install from the truckbed to the tailgate. I would never buy this again. In fact I\u2019m returning it and I just installed it.","Very good sturdy thick soft towels.","The book is loaded with useful info to form a new coaching habit! 4 star is because I don\u2019t like the structure of how the book is organized. Like any habit book, if you don\u2019t practice it, you won\u2019t improve.","This fits like a true plus size. I sit right between a 20 and 22, and the 22 fits...ok. The shorts seem low in the back. I'm used to high-waisted swimsuits, so I keep wanting to pull these higher. The mesh lining is poor quality and oddly attached only on the front of the shorts. Worst of all, the outline of your bits 'n pieces are visible through the shorts! I cannot emphasize this enough. It's cameltoe city with these! It's a bummer, because I like the length and fit of these shorts otherwise.","Never received it or refund.","They look and feel great but it does pull your hair on your arm a lot making it so you can not ware them","I had one of the digital gauges from the '80s. Was still working till a friend borrowed it and drove off with it on the trunk only to be destroyed. A good friend would have replaced it. But good friends and good tire gauges are hard to find. So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.","Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply. I did have to use tweezers because I have long nails. It was very sticky on its own. But would recommend using clear lash glue for the extra hold.","It works really well. Its sturdy so it can take punishment but its hard to clean up the mess but all around a great product.","It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.","One of these works fine, the other will not be recognized by my phone.","after just snapping the bracelet once it split open, the inside is a cheap sharp pieces of tape measures.","I like how it helps stand-up. I don't like how to put them on. They don't really help with the knee problem i have. I've only worn them once and look forward to wearing them under and on top of my pants. It's just a little hot now.","Pros : cost, obviously. This is a cheap item but it still works as it\u2019s supposed to. Cons : only one temp setting, hot. So you will need high heat oil / spray etc or it will burn your grease for the waffle and it will taste nasty.","No. Just no. This stuff is thick and cakey....and yes I just put on a few dots. Do not use this if you have any wrinkles because it will settle right in them and make you look older. I gave it 2 stars because the shade was great. The coverage is okay but not worth the definition of my wrinkles.","Seller sending spam to my email...Never will buy from again.","they sure aint what they used to be when i was a kid","This item was damaged. The description wasn't even what it explained it to be. It was supposed to be a gift. Very disappointed.","Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I\u2019ve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring. The colors are definitely a bit more neon than I would have thought, but that\u2019s fine! They do their job of easily distinguishing my keys.","I ordered it 1 size up and it still is a bit tight. I like my shirts to fit a bit looser. But it is a cute top and looks just like the picture.","I\u2019ve had a few sets of bunk beds for my twins. By far this one has been their favorite. It\u2019s very compact and leaves a lot more room in their room. I got the Black and it\u2019s in great shape. I will say this took my husband a few hours to put together. Lots of parts!! The ladder going up was my only issue. The metal hurts my daughter\u2019s feet climbing up/down. I tried a few different things to make it better and then I found my saving grace. A mega pool noodle!! Not just an ordinary one, mega. I cut one precisely and was able to get it perfect! Now she can climb up and down with out it hurting her feet!","Did not work for long and it is very small, when it did work at first it barely did anything to keep us warm","Items lid does not fit top of can. Can Feels half used. Very disappointed.","Works great and I'm still learning how to clean my griddle.","We got some stick-on Magic Sliders and after a few days they started coming off the chairs. After reattaching them a few times, all the glue was gone and they became worthless. If they stayed adhered to the chair legs they would be fine. They slide OK. You are probably better off getting felt pads which will also come off in time, but are a lot cheaper.","I have a spectra 1 pump and it fits in the bag but won\u2019t zip. I\u2019m fine with this as I will only be using it to take my pump to my parents when I visit and possibly to work if I\u2019m still pumping after 12 weeks. It will work for what I need it to but it is small.","Hi, I am loving the drone and it's features. However, one of the batteries that came with the drone is not charging. How can I have that sorted out?","it's still in wraps, but looks like a quality toy from the looks of things.","The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.","My dog is 2 lb. but still looks good on her! Not too big.","I saw it in a review and said what the heck... and low and behold its kinda annoying but I'm going to see if I can get used to it. Otherwise, it's a great mouse. Software is easy to use but you do need to map the buttons.","Broke after a year. Disappointing.","What I do like about this chicken is it always smells so fresh when opening the package. However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry. I think it's the gel absorbent pads they include in the packaging, it probably sucks all of the juice out of the chicken because I don't have that same problem with brands that don't use those pads. I'll stick to chicken that is vacuum-sealed.","My daughter loves her fairy house kit! It has held up nicely in our garden.","Smells great! You don't need to use very much and it's good as a setting spray.","so far so good! easy set up! Gave it 3 stars because it's not really Red! It is more of an orange color! I wanted Red....they could have went darker","Got good news and bad news. Good news is that thia was a cheap product and came on time. Bad news is that its not that great it money worth spent. Theres a reason why its cheap. Just brought a 4k ips uhd tv amd needed a 4k hdmi cable. Just a week in of using it. Thia product kept cutting out the video for reason. And switched it with a 4k hdmi cable from xbox one x and havent had no problems.","Beautiful, as all their pieces are, in my humble opinion.","Plugged and play didn\u2019t have to calibrate went together easy shipped early","Girlfriend completely Loved it! Makes her Macbook look amazing!!","Ok, update to my review... after only 15 months one of the Lasfit bulbs began to flicker on and off. Very disappointing. I was extremely satisfied with the Lasfit headlamps I purchased. A very good value (price was affordable), easy installation (a have a Toyota FJ Cruiser) and great customer support. I recommend Lasfit over the plethora of competitors! The lights produce clean white beams of light, much better than my original factory incandescent bulbs.","It's super cut but a bad fit. Got the Xsmall. However, it's adjustable around the girth but no adjustment for the neck.","I returned the product. The Q&amp;A said it would work fora rug on top of carpeting as well s hard flooring. It did not.","Like the product. Needed security for my Kindle Fire","Flickers when connected to a dimmer switch. Will also flicker if used where the temperature is low.","Made me sicker than a dog","Cute toy. Comes with batteries! 9 month old niece loved it.","Lower on me then I needed. Sits about an inch below my belly. Lace is pretty but it rolls down. Would be better if they were high waist.","While wider than I expected they will be perfect for a short cruise and pattern quite fun.","looked frumpy on me since I'm 5'2'' and gave it to my granddaughter who's a little taller, she seems to like wearing it with leggings.","My computer is without an external CD player. I bought this external DVD player / burner that does the work, without external power supply because there is only one cable, and especially that is recognized and recognizes all my cd / dvd read or write It works fine. compact. so far, so good. Perfect for the money. Very sensitive, do not touch or move when you burn a CD, and there is no noise during burning. It is worth buying.Reasonable price I saw.Recommend.","Seems to be of decent quality just with the fitment was better.","Mounts crooked. Nothing you can do will make it flush and flat. Wish I could get my money back or one that actually works correctly. Not happy wish I could do 0 stars","I haven't used yet. I bought this for an up coming trip to the Dominican. It appears to be built very well but I have not used yet.","Stopped taking a charge after a month. Just blinks red after days of trying to charge it.","It's beautiful, and the quality is very good.","I already buy this but, found it cheaper through here. I love that I don't have to keep buying little boxes in the store ( usually comes with 6) this is a better quantity for me. I eat this in the morning before leaving to work and it holds me good. I recommend this product.","Suppose to be good quality. My pup had the stuffing ripped out the next day. Bummer","Comfy like what I expect from Crocs shoes--can easily wear for 4-6 hours. But as they day goes on &amp; my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants &amp; jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps &amp; backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.","I wanted to keep this swimsuit but it ended up being too small. I wasn't comfortable in it and didn't feel confident. I ended up returning it. I'm 5'5\", 135 lbs, 34D - ordered a Large","I liked this kit a lot, I gave it to my daughter who babysits, and everyone joined in to paint rocks.","This game is fun and not crazy difficult but not super easy either!","For the price, it is good adjustable height ironing board. It does, however, wobbles somewhat because it is light weight. I only iron when I sew (hemming, etc) so it will work fine.","Not ideal for thick hair. It will hold a small french twist if you have a chin length bob but anything longer requires two.","It's a good sturdy item but the issue I have with it is that your feet are to uncomfortably close together to use at the same time","I planted my herb garden in this but had to take a few out as they weren\u2019t doing good. The front middle of each pocket seems to hang and so the water isn\u2019t distributed evenly. Still looks cool.","It's cool but huge and heavy. Like outdoor iron gate pieces on jewelry . Might be your cup of tea.","if you close the drawers all.the way-they are extremely difficult to open again","Very nice case - guys well, good protection","My little one said it is uncomfortable and we have a standard round toilet seat and the training seat would not fit it in!!!!","I was looking forward to taking Mastic Gum. My package arrived. No plastic Seal around the cap and the bottle was open. Wasted time and money. Do not order from them. Get them from somewhere else.","The bag with the hoes was wrinkled and not sealed.A nozzle was attached to the hose.","The texture is great, but this pepperoni is lacking in flavor. I was expecting a bit more spice and herbs. I would rather pick up some pre-sliced mass produced pepperoni from the store.","I ordered a ton of cables for my production studio set up and these cables are well made and for the most part work great. The only problems I've faced is when using them for my audio interface. They have issues and start causing data drops or glitching. Switched cables everything was great.","Thought I was getting votive holders because of the picture but instead got votive candles. Yikes. I do notice it's in the description now that it's too late. The candles are ok but I don't need them.","Very nice knife. Much better than I expected. Fast shipping","As a mattress, it works well for my daughter, but it's been 2 months and the mattress still smells.","These little catheters really help. No gripe water or gas drops will help as this product. My baby sleeps better now.","These are travel size.","This set is absolutely the most beautiful in person than on the website! Very soft to touch but sustainable. And it's wash &amp; dry!","The only problem I have with it is that the stand-up mechanism isn't that stable and we can't adjust the angle.","Right shoe was wider than left.","Helped me adapt a sim card for my hotspot","hi I received the case but it doesn't fit on my lap top,its too big ......can I return it for a smaller size","In the picture this dress looks loose and flowy. Even though it is only 5% spandex it clings to the body. The material is cheap and see through. I would not recommend this dress unless you are looking for fitted dress. Which I was not.","The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit. Thankfully it fit perfectly. Unfortunately the zipper gets stuck so bad. Last night I need help to get the zipper up, today no one can get the zipper up. It's not a size issue it's just the zipper. Ruins the look if the zipper doesn't zip!","I was a little disappointed in the quality of these. The magnets work well and the size fits with the other name brand ones I have but the plastic is definitely thinner than the name brand ones. Overall good buy for the price!","Loved the result but hair see dry","IT IS FINE, NO OTHER COMMENT TO MAKE AS IT WAS SIMPLY A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I SMASHED AT MY DAUGHTER'S HOME.","I am really disappointed with the light output and these are not \"extremely bright.\" I have white LED headlights and I thought that the yellow would contrast and fill in side areas not covered by the headlights. All I see are yellow highlights to each side of the headlight beam. Switch them off and there is barely a difference. To be fair I didn't have opportunity to try these in fog. I'm not sure how you rate longevity but these will probably last forever! Not that it makes much difference since they don't really do much, unlike the OEM lights that they replaced before one go them blew. Perhaps I should have bought the white.","If you like Devin you\u2019ll love it, if you\u2019re new to heavy Devi this is a great place to start.","Works ok decent product","Leaks brushes stain easily","We've had this thing for a long while now. I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.","The band was great until the stitching started to come undone after about 20 days.","Very cute. Quality not the best as the tie began to rip on my second wear. Also it is more robe like as it only ties. Easy to fix with a safety pin.","Out of 12 ornaments 6 were cracked. I guess the 6 functional ones are going to work well for what I need them for haven\u2019t tried yet. Just opened package.","Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.","Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.","for the price it didnt work very good so i sent it back","The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!","I bought this product for when I\u2019m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.","When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!","I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.","The calendar came damaged almost like a scratch on one of the dates. Not a huge deal but kind of a bummer since this wasn't exactly the cheapest calendar I could have purchased on amazon .","Oh my gosh! I hot to see my grand niece in her little outfit yesterday and I think it is the cutest thing ever! The sizing was perfect and the colors, bright and cheery! Her momma loves it and she received many compliments on it. Well made and beautiful fabrics.","My jar tasted like my grandfathers old milking barn smelled. I could not use this.","Totally love this! Very pretty! I\u2019ve seen these years ago and when I found this on Amazon I ordered right away!","It was not what I wanted.","Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.","The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.","I had new sod put in over the summer. I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!","Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat. My dog is not allowed on the couch but just rubbing up against it and the static from this fabric attracts so much white fur. A fine cover, I\u2019d say, for a house with no animals.","My uncle loved the shirt i got it for him material is perfect and tank you seller","It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.","The shoe fits great but feels thin on the sole. But for the money, it's great. Guessing pro soccer players wouldn't be using this but for what I need it for, it works.","I don\u2019t think this got very hot and felt very heavy.","This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.","This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.","..fine to use for light snacks","The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside. My son tried to use his rake to move some dirt around in our raised bed garden and it bent where the tool meets the stake - eventually breaking completely after that. The pieces are fairly flimsy and it is pretty small even for my 2 year old.","Dominos didn\u2019t fit in the slots. Had to return.","This part arrived today not very happy by the quality of this product it\u2019s made very cheap for the price. Will probably be corroded in about 2weeks. I expect to be changing this part very soon","The material is thin and transparent. The threading is already loose prior to wear. They are comfortable otherwise.","Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone","Replacing previous pair that lasted two years and would\u2019ve lasted longer if hubby didn\u2019t where them as slide on slippers at times. These are a good purchase. Heavy duty, made to last, keep feet dry. Comfortable too!","Just felt lose like it was going to fall apart easily.","said juicer / blender - there is no juicer component","SO EASY! I love it! First time with hard floors and I just grab this and sweep up stuff - it works well and is lightweight.","Very good read. Keep me entertained an wanting to come back for more. Vrry intriguing. Loved the storyline an Talon.","I like the color of the bag but the look of the bag could be a little more stylish. Overall, the bag provides enough storage space for all the necessities.","Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.","Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.","I bought this twice. And returned it twice. It arrived with the glass broken in multiple pieces. What's wrong with your shipping department, Amazon???? I'm not the only one who has returned this item because it arrived broken. Please learn how to properly wrap, mark and ship fragile glass. SO DISAPPOINTED!","Does this camera have to be on a HD dvr","Instructions were sometimes difficult to understand, but given it was our very first time trying a murder mystery it was fun. We will do again - hoping for better results now that we (somewhat) know what we\u2019re doing.","Remote stopped working already. Bought new batteries thinking that was the issue but just more money down the drain.","These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I\u2019m impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.","Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.","It\u2019s nice but very disappointed on the way it was packaged, small box in a bigger box, no styrofoam packaging and came opened up in box just flopping around. Hope it works or I\u2019ll be calling for a refund. Thank You!","The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.","Blackout curtains so much better than they used to be. These are a decent size and texture. Perfect length.","There is only one and for the price you can find others online that cone with 2. Very disappointed since the photos show 2.","It didn\u2019t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn\u2019t show in the picture","These are well made, super cute &amp; a great size","I use this for hiking and open water swimming in mountain lakes. The product is well built. It is fairly heavy material. It is very important to have it fully inflated or it drags when you swim. That is why I am giving it three stars.","Water these for my cat was disappointed when recived product had a hole in each side of thumb of glove","It doesn't fit good with the phone, in does not stick in the sides","Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.","Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.","Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere","I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.","Being my first product like this I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\u2019s a decent toy.","Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it. It was so aggravating I almost returned it for that alone. Never again Netgear","This is an addictive, albeit (very) gory game. Frankly, I would not recommend this for teens. I would not recommend it to anyone with aggression issues or anyone from Germany. Contains some boob nudity.","I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.","love it but xl runs a little small... now eating no carbs lol","Was looking for taller pieces with more weight. There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.","Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.","I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.","The scent is more masculine. The product wasnt what I expected.","Work great and good quality","The hatch looked great, fit well and worked well initially. In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover. I had to purchase a metal hatch cover for $26 to replace it. Seller refused to replace it, 1 year warranty, I was 2 weeks outside that window when I emailed them. Run, don't walk from the product and the seller.","Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....","I lake every thing about this camera the colors very clear","I love that this is a rapid charge for two different USB ports! It makes on the go charging a breeze for us! Just plug in your power cord's USB connection and boom you will be all charged up and ready to go before you get to your destination!","Really helps eyeshadow stay on all day.","The seller shipped fast and there was no problems with the order. However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.","(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports. They break easily / are not at all durable. In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.","I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket. The fact that it came from Pakistan makes it pointless to return, I'd probably have as much in shipping charges as I have in the jacket. I can only shake my head at this point !","This is a beautiful product. however is not made for curly hair it pulls and gets tangled.","Is it a strong as I thought it was going to be it's flavorful but lacks the strength in coffee flavor","Very pretty..But you might want to get a larger size up..","This is adorable and just what I was looking for \u2026. a little girl's 4th birthday. The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.","Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.","I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better. The Royal cushion, which I also have, is $25 less and WAY more supportive/comfortable.","This Bear is cute, but it said in the description that it was 20\". As you can see in my photo I attached, it is almost 12\". That is a huge difference to me.","Did not hold up for even one month of play at our club. Fiberboard under attractive painting so did not withstand being left outside. Fell apart.","Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.","Smells good and keeps the bugs away","I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.","Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again","I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \"indoor\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)","Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.","It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old","Exceedingly fake-looking.","Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.","There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.","The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids","I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","It\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off","Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt. Way too much money for the size it is. It looks flat.","Exactly what I wanted! I have 3 cams outside. They are under sheds, so cannot talk about how weatherproof they are. But they, for sure, look nice.","This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item! My family and I totally loved it!","But definitely order 1 size large then most, very cheap fabric, but it\u2019s being used for a costume so will do","only for indoor application. if you have no lip on the inside, it has to go on the outside. the magnets dont stick tightly at all, big gaps especially corners where insects will come in. i do not recommend.","Battery did not power up my watch .","Works great for my Deebot!","The only thing I didnt like was that the pointy part of the velcro is too thick and I'm constantly afraid it might poke my baby. I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.","The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.","Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.","Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.","Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2\" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5\" range instead of stopping at 3\". Still a handy tool though.","OK, but crumbly and stale.","Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since","I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.","I have an older mule that I use for riding 4 or 5 times a week and I love it. This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding","One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty","brass fittings very thin","This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.","This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!","For the price it\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider","As promised...it works!","A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.","Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy. Buttons are flimsy and toy does not always react fast to the commands. The main positive is that the toy is sturdy.","Too big for my Christmas tree... is good material but too big.","Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.","Works great in the bright florida sun.","I love this case it fits perfect for my Mac Pro 15 inch, the cover is soft and the design is nice. Love that it comes with a screen protector, it does bubble up a bit","It is easy to use &amp; it works. Have only used it once.","Chipped wood when it arrived","I have not burned my old chair yet. I\u2019m sure the new chair it will fit &amp; look good.","This kit is designed too small ,and the location is too high for the phone to place on ,I can see only half the screen.","Dissapointing product","Great idea and format, but lacks answers to exercises. The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).","Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!","I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade. You must be careful or you can nick or cut a pet easily. Probably a great tool for professionals or experienced groomers or if your pet stays fairly still when trimming.","wait and see how it works this winter","Perfect for what i needed it for ...","Very inconsistent in connection.","Received a completely plain white t shirt!","very hard and uncomfortable.","Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.","I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.","Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \u201cclean out\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!!

<p>Looks interesting! If you hover over the distinct clusters on the chart, you should be able to recognize common topics. Some of these topics are related to a single category, some of them are shared across categories. What topics can you find in the chart?</p>

<p>Looking at the chart above, we can get a sense for some of the topics in our corpus, but it doesn't solve our problem yet. It would require lots of time to review the chart in detail, find clusters, and label them. How can we automate this process?</p>
<p>BERTopic is one of the methods to achieve that. It depends on sentence embeddings and clustering algorithms, as well as dimensionality reduction to produce clusters of documents (topics). Let's if we can get some good insights with this approach.</p>

<pre>Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can&#39;t help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila.
I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
I loved this book!! Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty&#39;s best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own. The fantasy world is beautifully detailed with magic and tension and tenderness throughout.
I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light.
This is a great book so far. I haven&#39;t finished it, but I cant wait to! Well worth the great price!
The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn’t explain who was whom very well.
I want to see how Kevin lives or dies! And does he fall for his best friend eventually? Lots of twists and turns.
This was a good short story,and a great deal of action in it. Although most people don&#39;t know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it.
Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it’s a fun book!
I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery’s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.

Edit: I have been wearing this for less than two months and it is 100% worn out. It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it\u2019s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.","Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.","Well it\u2019s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that\u2019s a lie it has 3 so that\u2019s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it\u2019s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better","Very, very thin, you can bend them with you fingers with no problem! Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!","Super cute! Loved it until I noticed that the casing around the purple rock was coming apart straight out of the package. SAD!","Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3\" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.","These bags have a lot of space in them, good thing about these bags is that I can easily see what's inside then. Very reasonable price.","Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.","Broke down after a month's use!!","Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module","Nice looks like picture","Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it! Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!","I\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.","Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure","Item was not sealed and was missing parts","There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.","Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.","It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.","Buy this light. For the price you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing.","Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can't help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila.","This was never received...","Stitching came undone immediately. Already took tags off so couldn't return. Disappointed.","Seems to be working for my older dog. The vet recommended this brand.","The USB was configured incorrectly to fit into my 2016 Hyundai Sonata. When I turned it over so that the USB would connect, the audio connector was on the wrong side. Won't work at all!","Have not received over a month ago I ordered this","Only gave one because couldn\u2019t leave no stars. This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it\u2019s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either","Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.","Great prices and props for my photo booth company.","I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn\u2019t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I\u2019ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.","Its perfect for my purpose, its lite weight is perfect, and so soft and warm. I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.","When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this","The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.","unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!","It's a fast charger but it doesn't charge the phone as fast as my plug in. It's nice but a fast cord charger is better.","Perfect Christmas gift for my sister! She loved them. The bands are very difficult to change!","The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.","Some of the designs are hard to recognize.","Sadly, the pages were alllllll but 3 riped from the book. I wanted to return it but I was involved in a car accident and was unable to. But I\u2019m disappointed that it was sent out in that condition.","Not very powerful. Noisy.","Beautiful shoes but rhinestone fall off. Found two and replaced them with glue but have lost some permanently. Still like the shoes.","Nice color. My cabinet looks like new.","It\u2019s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\u2019m off my feet because I don\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else","Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.","Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.","Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.","Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.","Did not charge my psp well at all","Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.","Have not used this because we cannot figure this out","Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!","Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced. I checked the local Ace hardware store, thinking it would have to be cheaper, but the flapper on Amazon was actually three bucks cheaper.","Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.","Stick well, peel easy and stay on the wall. Exactly what I was hoping for my nursery. We had painted the walls and no damage done.","the hinge broke after one year - not even a year of heavy use.","That's make me cough be better","I have long, fine hair. These are hard to put in & pull my hair when I take them out.","A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.","Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\u2019s a Jeep and we\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\u2019t chipped, I\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).","We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.","Too big for my face. Look good & packages good!! Quick delivery!","It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!","Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.","I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars","From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.","I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.","I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are. It is tight on the calves and arms.","It was a nice product over all but trimmer Broke after a month.","4/5 from a satisfied customer. I saw a similar product advertised on Facebook and searched for it on Amazon. This was the same product I saw and cheaper. It performs as its supposed to. Unfortunately the size of the glove is too big for my hand.","Product only lasted probably 10hrs before shorting out. Used it in bass amp for concerts. Would definitely purchase professional quality next time.","This is not for kids. Horrible. Bloody shark swimming around saying it will of into your room and you will meet your doom. Who approved this and rated it as G?!","Great case overall, it's very hard and protects the phone very well. Only thing I dislike a little is the buttons are a bit hard to press, but you get used to over time.","never really worked. unable to get it to work..","Product as discribed, cracks very easily though. Seems cheap","The company sent me another one as the first bracelet broke in a few days, well this is bracelet number 2 delivered on Monday and broke in the same spot. The quality is just not up to par. I have reached out to the seller because I do in fact need a bracelet that is reliable","I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly","Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient","My bird family that lives in our back yard loved this bird food. They are flying in from the neighborhood. Thank you for providing nourishment and joy to my family of birds.","Granddaughter loved it, she\u2019s into anything strawberry!","Warm and dry. Good fit around ankle for support.","Pretty decent and sharp but the middle section gets stuck sometimes...kinda annoying","Great bag... just wish it had an extra pocket inside.","Loved it..... a gift that I did not think I would use.... I was wrong. It is great!","I dislike the fit it\u2019s very cheep wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone","My son really wanted this hoodie so when it arrived he was pleased. It is very thin however and there were several loose threads. The style is neat and different. For the price I was expecting something a little bit better quality however.","Its o.k. but not as thick as another brand I previously used. I think the other brand lasted longer in my hair for the day.","Ordered for my son who is deployed and he loved it!! He said it was the perfect pre workout!","Just what the doctor ordered. Love the flexibility and range of temperatures.","I wish I could give 5 stars. As far as the glasses go, I absolutely love them. But three glasses arrived completely shattered","They are sticky but probably because of the heat -- they were in the mail box and we had high temps in AR","Helpful on my trip to the UK. The computer chargeing ports are a nice extra","Bought these to cycle through a newly bought shotgun. Did not jam.","We received this today. It's beautiful. Love the shiny chrome. Easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. Just needed to open up the battery compartment to add six AA batteries and the liquid hand soap. Screwed in the three screws and placed it on our bathroom wall. Works like a charm!","It made it so much easier to rotate my inside plants!","Solid construction. Not as flimsy as the other inexpensive type C cords out there.","This is a well-made, very attractive alarm. I received an outdated instructions sheet so when I emailed the company with a question, I received immediate, helpful response. I\u2019m very impressed with this company.","Not easy to use at all","I thought i was receiving two dog jackets. As shown in the picture. I only received the red coat. Picture is misleading and i am disappointed. I am a frequent buyer from amazon. Very disappointed, misleading with the picture above.","It was ok needs jewellery to make it look great.","Spring is not easy to use. The other items are great","This is my second one from Oh La La Cheri because it fits perfectly, is actually open crotch in the right spot, is comfortable and made well enough to last a while. My fianc\u00e9 loves it.","Ink smudges every 2 inches on right edge of paper, all copies , not quality I need to be sending to clients, learned my lesson , 14 $ for two cartridges , will go back to others I ordered that worked fine, pay a little more , get it done right the first time","worst smells like chemicals I hate it never bought powder worst than this afraid to use and get an acne","I have never ordered this brand but heard great things, not sure if those brown areas are normal or not","They\u2019re great, durable and fit well. I do recommend setting them outdoors to air out for a few days until you put them in your car.","These show with every pair of shoes I have tried then with. They have seams on the toes which make them uncomfortable.","These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.","For some reason, I bought these to ride my bike with in the cold. They suck for that. Not bad for just walking around, though. I didn't know they were touchscreen compatible til I saw the description again, so I can't comment on how well they work on a cellphone.","The size was off, I usually wear a lrg. or x-lrg. But this was snug I wanted to order larger but was sold out.","Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.","Great product. Delivered timely.","This fascinator looked cute when I did not move, but it was too heavy to stay in place. I used the clip on the headband, but the whole thing kept falling forward on my forehead. At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)","Nice pair of leggings. Very comfortable. I haven\u2019t wash them yet but they seem safe. If not, I\u2019ll update.","Horrible tool. Went to loosen a bolt and the head of the tool broke.","I purchased this item to use for my sons prom send off, the only balloons that were able to be used were the latex ones, no foil balloons could be used, also the discription shows a 2018, I was sent a 2019, which means the day of prom last minute I had to go and purchase the correct numbers which cost me an extra 40 dollars... I'm so disappointed..","Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.","Very good toy. Very tuff to.","2 of my markers were dry. The f Green and purple markers were completely dry. Unsatisfactory","Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library before buying this book. Wish I had. Trust your gut instinct. That's it. Nothing more.","I like them because sometimes you order thing that are not the size they say. these are large the size they say love them.","Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18\" long 1/2\" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2\" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2\" angle iron, each 15\" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.","Much smaller than anticipated, the picture looks like it\u2019s a man\u2019s bracelet when in reality it\u2019s more for a woman. The clasp is impossible to use one handed making it impossible to put on alone, must have help. I will be returning and not recommending this to anyone.","Very nice keepsake box, Purchased for a gift.","I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.","best buy is at Costco or Smith&Final","I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.","The shot glasses are all scratched up. Poor quality. Will not but again.","The antelope color is not the same as I expected it to be. Looks different online.","looks better in person than online. somewhat hard to tighten the band by yourself, also can be uncomfortable if you tighten too much since it is not a flexible band.","The top was a bit tight and I'm a 36 B. I got a medium. I prob would still wear top but underboob is inevitable since the straps are not adjustable. Otherwise the top was cute. Bottoms fit weird and where the strappy parts are on each side the inner lining (tan/white material) showed no matter what and looked super odd. Not cute at all. Maybe I am just too wide for them. I have a 26\" waist. Def for SHORT PETITE people.","These are inedible. I am a health food freak and I have tried many products over the years that have been awful tasting but this tops the cake. I have never tasted a cough drop so disgusting in my life","The product just work a few days, and broken.","I gave this mascara 2 stars, because I would love to use it; although I cannot. The wand is in very poor condition, the brush fibers are falling off and are crushed. For $28 I am very, very disappointed. It did not appear in great, new condition when it arrived.","I am vision impaired and thought this tape would highlight places I need to see. I left it in the sun for a day, applied it, and hoped for the best. Result? Nothing. I can tell the tape is there only by feeling.","This chair is fine. It's a little too rolly, also it doesn't recline unless you pull the lever, which is a little weird but I guess I get it. Okay chair--you get what you pay for.","Very happy with my purchase. It was an excellent price, and the product was just as described, Looks great in my home theater!","Purchased this and one week later it failed. Cannot reach Polycom for replacement. Returning to Amazon as defective.","This was a gift for my grandson. He was so disappointed because there were no lights or sounds as it said on the box. The drill only turned one way. Not happy with it at all.","I bought two chairs and was super excited to put them together. These are definitely cute and are nice quality. The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the \u201cneck\u201d piece, the other didn\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don\u2019t screw them in as far, you\u2019re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.","Great quality for a reasonable price. I used this at a baby shower I hosted and everyone was impressed! SO pretty!!","I loved this book!! Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty's best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own. The fantasy world is beautifully detailed with magic and tension and tenderness throughout.","Got this for my 7 year old. He loves police officers and this puppet was the perfect size for him. Gives him hours of enjoyment too. This was shipped out fast and very well made. I highly recommend.","I bought this a little over three months ago, and while I thought it was a good bag up until now, the bag's strap snapped as I picked it up while leaving the gym. I'd recommend this bag if you need something on the cheaper side but I'm not sure if just my bag is like this or if this is routine.","Lasted a whopping two weeks before it ripped with minimal usage of my AirPods. Not worth the money but too late to return. On the plus size, it was easy to install and looked really nice before it ripped. Maybe I got a bad batch?","I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!","Bought as a new one, but it was used! Verry disappointed!","Nunchuck plug doesn't fit well.. and falls apart upon removal. Also loses sync with wii frequently.","Update: Its ok diaper cream. It separates very easily and it does have a very ROSE LIKE smell. I am still going to use it but not sure I will keep using this brand. I prefer the Target and Walmart brand better so far.","So soft. Just watch the stitching","Works well. So do real cameras :) would buy again.","Overall product is well constructed, Holds a charge well 2 or 3 uses before recharging. The fit is well for me and my wife however,the range is only about 4 tractor trailer lengths away before losing contact and the sound quality is not what I expected for what I paid...its not a packed crisp sound...but more or less a crackly weak sound, not a bad product , I just want the reader to know what yo expect before you spend over 300.00 like I did expecting a little more.","It's a decent hat for the price. For me, the stitching was odd so the hat looked cheaply made. But that's just me, I'm quite picky. Overall it's a decent hat for the price.","Just got the case and it\u2019s too small. What the heck??? Anyone else had this problem???","I use this product in my bedroom which is facing south with too much sunlight. This curtain works well blocking the sunlight. And the price is good.","I used these strips for accent lighting behind my PC monitor and under the shelf that it sits on. Very easy to install and operate. The instructions are very clear for setup and couldn\u2019t have been easier to follow. I wish I could find one or two more of the extension/connector cables by themselves that match what\u2019s in the package so I can put these strips in different places for various lighting, but I guess I\u2019ll have to stick with what I have.","I really want to give this suit a 5 star but I can\u2019t. The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size. It all fits there but the cup size in a xxl looks as if it is a triple d or a double d. I am a larger girl being 249 but my chest is smaller. Would love to exchange sizes but cant find anywhere to message sender.","I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light.","Is OK but runs small","Our son loves this costume, I don\u2019t, necessarily because the picture online makes it appear to be a shiny and body fitting costume but it is not. The shiny part is actually white designs and not necessarily body fitting. It is padded which I do like.","I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don\u2019t have something underneath. They are good quality though.","i loved it! it came in great condition as well","I just wish it would save the names.","The leash was good before it ripped. My dog is 45 pounds, order the medium, she is strong and pulls sometimes, but is not a persistent puller. The leash ripped and is no longer usable after 4 months...","I have lots of problems with this rice cooker because the liquid often steams out and the rice doesn't get enough liquid. There is no hole in the lid to allow some steam out.","wire broke off on inside","i think that says it all .","I read anothers review of this item and agree, the doors are tough to hang straight. Also be careful of the backing screws as in the middle front lower shelf you can see how the screws broke away the bottom shelf. Otherwise its great!","I wasn't so excited to get this float but I will be returning it. Immediately upon inflating it I discovered a large tear in the stitching. The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.","nice gag gift but rather small","Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you\u2019d want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!","Watch came without extra sizing links. Cannot purchase the links without purchasing a new $180 band. Will be returning","They are comfortable except hard to get used to with the controls ..... buttons in odd places","Was a baby shower gift that was on the baby register list. Got a very nice thank you card.","Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read","Feels quality for the price. As advertised.","I like the colors and the staying power of these glosses. A good value for my money. They are a bit sticky so only 4 stars.","Very disappointed with these balloons. One of the big rings came with a hole in it and another two balloons popped as I was filling them with helium.","This doesn\u2019t play well. Pauses in places and will not load the rest of the movie. Could only watch to first 50 mins.","One star because I couldn\u2019t not leave 0. This case does not work, when I did the stress test it worked but when I took it in the water, it was not water proof. This at best is water resistant","Great flavor but not sure if it actually works","The dress had little holes in multiple places, unable to return it, didn\u2019t notice until I wore it and others pointed out the holes! I guess when you buy cheap clothes you get cheap quality!","We ordered a 24 pack and received only a 12 pack","This a great case for the price. It looks great while also providing the protection that I need for my iPhone.","This does seem to extend the length of my manicure but I don't find it the miracle product others do. I get maybe 5-7 days instead of 2-3 out of my polish with this.","I initially purchased this plan to cover a dash cam from defects, accidental damage, ect, but when it came time to file a claim, the company refused to cover my accidental damage claim, and I had to jump through hoops showing them proof of purchase of my insurance plan, because apparently, the insurance plan ID for some reason wasn't enough. I've dealt with asurion before and I've never had problems like this, so insure your purchased Amazon goods at your own risk.","This is a great book so far. I haven't finished it, but I cant wait to! Well worth the great price!","these eyelashes are actually pretty decent if you are looking for a more natural look. they are very lightweight and flexible for easy application, not thick at all.","Excellent product - feels great and very therapeutic. My massage therapist recommended this for reflexology.","I\u2019m disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.","Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.","I have found it really hard to put on magnetic lashes that have 2 magnetic bars per lash. They are difficult to line up both at the same time, and they aren't as long as a realistic lash line. I ended up cutting each lash pairing in half so they are smaller chunks with one magnetic bar per lash set. This is much easier and looks better.","The things I liked most about this product are the attractiveness of it and it's light weight. There are no downsides that I can see.","It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.","I like the color and design of this toaster. It fits perfectly in my kitchen counter top. Bread toasts uniformly and can remove bread crumbles from the bottom tray. I highly Recommend this.","Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.","Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume","I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.","Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.","Since I installed the head, I have noticed a slight vibration. Although it still does the job will","Great info from a history buff","Was amazing for the first 2 weeks, and then my armpits became so irritated that I had to quit using!","Did not receive Entire Order. Called & cancel the part of the order I didn't receive. I was told I would Have a refund & someone would call me. NO calls or contact , or refund at this point & time ??????","Poor finish, Poor fit. Cut my finger on the jagged finish. Holes didn't line up. Shipped back the same day and I had to pay for shipping. BOOO.","I ordered this because I love Cuban coffee that I drink while I\u2019m on Florida. It did not live up to its name. Will not order again.","Nice thick shirt, good quality. No issues with the prints being off. Usually wear XL and the XL size fit perfectly. The design and color are awesome. Would recommend!","This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars","Not the best quality. Some arrived broken.","My baby loves the baby gym. As soon as I lay her down on it her eyes light up with joy and there is a smile from ear to ear. She laughs and giggles and has the best time with it. Honestly, great gift for any mom or great for your own child too. The babies love it! This product is 5 stars","I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I\u2019m rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.","Open the box and discover a top side snap already cracked. I want to give this a chance but wonder about the durability of this product now.","Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy","Very very wide shoes. Only good for babies with extreme foot chub in comparison to foot length. The velcro also doesn't hold well at all. Super cute, though.","They are pretty cool, but don\u2019t drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.","The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height","*** update The handles have worn out and one of them broke off. I still use it but it's no longer as useful. At least it still holds stuff. Original comment: Works great. Durable. I ended up buying 2 of these after having my first. Do wish there was some sort of expandable strap for carrying on shoulder or in one hand. Great product.","Spring clip is too weak, jewelry is easily lost. disappointed","Stopped working after 3rd light yard work. Chain just scrolls. Too late for Amazon return. I liked how lightweight it was.","i never received this item","Hard to get excited about Snap Ring fasteners/washers. I needed two for grocery cart wheel replacement, anyone need the rest ???","We like that it\u2019s insulated and we like that it\u2019s unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don\u2019t know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.","Seems like a good idea but I found I didn\u2019t really need it.","Way too small. I got a large for my 9.5 feet and can't get it on.","While they may be effective if your cat will eat it, mine turned up her nose to these hairball treats.","Great quality glass screen protector. So much better deal than getting it at the cell phone store. The screen is a nice thickness and is super easy to apply. You don't have to mess with any bubbles or anything. Great price and great screen protector!","These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.","I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.","This cookie cutter is so small!","Bought for car, but the base is smaller than the top, so it toppled over very easily. Perfect size, not great execution","Wow, this protein powder can get so fluffy & light! If you are a fan of protein fluff, this is by far the best product! No xantham gum needed!!","Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.","Made my first bars in this today. I ordered it because it was a favorite of Sally's Baking Addiction. This is a high quality pan.","Being African-American, my hair/scalp is naturally dry and I can't wash it more than once a week or it becomes brittle. Maui Moisture is the first shampoo in a long time to help hold the moisture until the next time I can wash my hair. Really happy I found it.","Smaller than I expected !! It will do \ud83d\udc4d","Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.","Came in a box with other items I ordered all of which are fine, but the ceramic casserole was wrapped in a thin bubble wrap which is not sufficient to protecting it. So now, it\u2019s smashed. Do I really have to send back this garbage?","This works fantastic on vinyl .","Do not buy, it will crush your bullets.","Bought these one pulled apart the 1st night used. Another quit 3rd. Time used. Giving 2 to see how the last 2 hold up.","The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn\u2019t explain who was whom very well.","I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.","Not as durable or water resistant. Case pops open every drop","Product is not as described. Not a one+ cable at all. Not even a cheap knock off.","haven\u2019t used the refills yet. Got this as an accompaniment to a tactical pen. Expect it perform nicely","can't say too much about it.. arrived with glass lens broken and had to return","Not an unlocked phone ... a VERIZON phone belonging to someone ... missing accessories.","This is a prob with seller.. I ordered this product Sept. 16, 2019 and ordered two which gave me four balls for the toy which used. 1. I received a pack of two today which I did not order. I never put it on auto order either. I don't want anyone choosing what and when I order my stuff. Now I am chg for this and I may have enough already for the year. The batters will be dead by the time I use the one sent today. What is going other. Never hd any problems with other seller. I am not happy! The balls are wonderful otherwise.","I really like the design of the backpack, but it is not practical for a college student. This is a good backpack to hold maybe 2 books. There\u2019s days where I walk almost 2 miles because of my classes and my back is hurting and aching. It\u2019s a very bulky backpack and doesn\u2019t fit much in it. I have to shove things back in if I take something out. I also cannot have my 15\u201d laptop in it without taking something else out. It also smelled strong of plastic when I first got it. I\u2019m going to be upgrading from this backpack.","I love the product. I feel more energetic after a few weeks of taking this.","I did not like the way they were packaged. There was huge tacks that You had to pull out so it ripped mine","Not one single cable worked! All of them say \u2018the accessory may not be supported.","Easy to assemble and sturdy, light enough to pick up and move, and the speakers sound great. However, this chair is far from comfortable. you sink into the chair for lack of cushion, and you can feel the front board in the chair on the back of your legs. Also, the curve at the lumbar portion of the chair arcs your back and causes pain after a short time. Recommend extra padding/lumbar support if you get this chair.","Too small for my dog","Great handle, 4 stars because it took nearly a month to arrive. Should have read they were coming direct from China.","my granddaughter wears them but the shoe itself is large","Works great took the squeaking out and looks great","I bought two units and overall love the mobile music. Both units were processed the exact same. While listening to them, my second unit's battery only lasted about 20 hours. The first unit still showed full charge! I just downloaded the Monster phone app so going to see how that works later today. Great sound, variable battery life.","Works great. I had this skin tag on my face, I used it multiple times to get rid of my skin tag. I finally got rid of it, it does irritate the surrounding area after using it, make sure you put a medical tape on the tag after applying the solution to minimize redness and irritation. Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, it did exactly what was advertised.","I love this! So many options for fruit teas and water. So easy, it almost makes itself. The lid will strain the fruit as it pours.","Is not what I expected. Memory foam too thin.looks nice.","You will need to pump ut up a lot to get more than a single spray from this. Disappointing but looks nice if you don't mind the extra work.","No assembly was nice. Made in America \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Arrived in open box, one bent stake which I managed to straighten, no packing slip (probably due to completely open box) Perfect addition to the garden. Would purchase again.","Does not even work. wasted my money.","There isnt enough glue to stick it on your eye and make it stay. Not worth the money and it isnt eligible for returns sadly.","This is on my wall of clocks","I only used this swim cap twice a week for two months and it tore. Pretty disappointing since I have the same cap in another color that I have used for a year and a half with no problems. Just wanted a different color.","Lightning plug sunk down in just over a month and the adapter was unable to be repaired.","Fake!! These are fake pens. They do not work!! I ordered these to use as back up to my digital bill detector. I keep a fake $100 in the office of my restaurant to help train staff. It\u2019s a known fake. The digital detector caught the bill so I know it\u2019s fake. These pens show that it\u2019s real!! I have other fake bills used for training staff and it says those are real as well. Come on amazon!! Stop letting people sell fake stuff on here!!","One fits, the other falls off. Poor quality control in the sizing and construction. Soles are hard rubber and sound like dress shoes on hardwood floors, so not very optimal for indoor use.","It take forever for the polish to come off with these pads","Good quality. Comfy.","the loop on the handle broke after a couple of uses.","One of the four bulbs was defective and would not work","OMG...I bought this for my 4 year old grand daughter. It is perfect for the desk we just got her. First of all she can't break it. she can twist and turn it. There is no plug so it is portable...it charges with a USB cord which is provided by the way. The light dims and brighten...can be used as a nightlight also. Lastly,,,it has a pencil holder. It is the cutest light ever. I do recommend","This book was chosen for book club. I was initially interested and then quickly lost interest. I found it hard to follow at times and lost interest quickly. It was hard to finish and I only had about 15 pages left to read before book club and just never had the interest to finish the last pages.....","a little flimsy but doesn't show in presentation. used these for my students water colors for a gallery show. everyone was impressed how nice things look. would recommend for student work.","Well worked great for like 3 days but then started falling apart","Not what it looks like","My kids and grandkids love this item. It is a good transport for sports, picnics, camping, and more for this active family. Th quality of this product is very high; it folds and stores very nicely.","Decent quality jumpers at a good price. Don't put too much strain on these, they're not meant for them. Get a 90deg adapter instead.","I want to see how Kevin lives or dies! And does he fall for his best friend eventually? Lots of twists and turns.","Only giving it three stars because the charger works fine, but I put a screen protector on 3 days ago and it\u2019s already cracked. I don\u2019t do anything ridiculously rough to my watch but it shouldn\u2019t crack after three days.","These r very nice. Big and good quality.","I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.","I bought two sets of them and one set came with the middle diamonds being clear and smaller.","The pens themselves are nice, espcially for the price. However, the ink is terrible. I\u2019ve had these pens for a month and both are struggling to write.","Be careful, the small allen screw that holds the light stripped after adjustment. The company should at least use stronger material screws.","Purchased 8 months ago and both broken now.","Beautiful item but the glass cross was broken in 4 pieces when I opened the box due to no packing material. Needed ASAP for a gift.","This item is exactly what we needed and ordered. It works and is compatible with our i phones.","It looks easier than it is. I ran around trying to fill this thing with air and it took several tries. I looked ridiculous. Finally got enough air in it to make it work. I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner. Not able to get the water out...and worried about mold...it ended up in the trash. Pretty bummed. The idea is great if it had worked for us.","So I thought I would be getting some type of a \"minty orange\" lifesaver....(I wonder why? Look at the name of them!!!) WHen I tried my first one....Nope...NO \"mint\"! It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice \"bright\" flavor over \"Mint\"....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good! Just not \"mints\" as they state....","Slightly off white and loose","Love this dress, I probably should order a smaller size since it is a bit loose in the top and very long on me.","The waist is too high and the bottom too long. I could get away with it but I like my leggings to be be fitted. I might have them altered or I send them back. Not sure yet. Fabric is on the thin size but not see through. Expected for the price. I am 5.2 so I would recommend for taller people! It adjusts well to my size which I am small/medium legging size. Perhaps they could create a petite size!","Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark & seem to be of cheaper quality","I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.","Needed to flash it to get it working with my NVR system (shinobi). Seems to be working now.","Talk about a POS!! I ordered this to replace a broken cover on my iPad. I got this and while putting it on my iPad it BROKE! Super cheap material and I so disappointed with the quality that I put the new and old screen covers in the trash! Don't waste your money as this will just disappoint you.","Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.","This is a great product; however, the powder doesn't blend completely.","Ordered a tinted they shipped me a clear one","I've had a Roomba. It died after several years of hard use. It worked on hard flooring and rugs. This eufy RoboVac is a piece of crap. I'll be returning it. It does not work on floors with rugs even thin low ones. It gets stuck constantly and can't get itself out of it. After this experience I'll buy another Roomba.","The directions that came with the crib for assembly, were completely wrong. It was not as easy to put together as expected. Other than, the crib is great and is good for small spaces.","I love the look and lightness of this wig! The only issue for me is that it does not come with combs or a front lace. However, I purchased a wig grip and it stays in place perfectly! Will buy again!","Loved it soooo much I ordered another set!","Worked great on the first bottles of shampoo & conditioner, when I switched them to the new bottles 1 of them quit working.","I have wavy hair and I thought this would enhance my waves. It did nothing actually and didn't tame the frizz at all. I'm highly disappointed.","Meh. They cut out some noise, but don't make a great seal. Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.","It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.","Light weight, easy to place on your car for mounting your phone. Great for young adults","Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.","I've never used a knife sharpening stone so this was interesting. Sharpened my knives quite well. It has been hard to find something that works in sharpening my kitchen knives, this worked.","so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can \"grab\" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally \"modified\" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.","My son loved it, because he much prefers the xbox control layout over the nintendo switch layout.","As soon as i got this product and one half dont work","I could not get the lights to stay in position. I tried tightening them but got no better results. I wanted to aim them where the light would be best for my seedlings and was not satisfied with the results.","The second day (in a row) we used it, didn't hold the air anymore.","Sadly, it was too small.","The quality is very poor and is not 3000PSI Wast of money RIP OFF","I was disappointed that these were a jersey material with a wired bow design not bandana material. They are a little big for my head but they are cute and comfy.","I,ve used Franklin Covey Planners for over 20 years. I have found them extremely helpful in tracking my work-I,m an attorney. While other attorneys use their phone or an I-Pad as a Calendar I can look up my cases and dates much faster.","they are nice but not as good of a material as i would have liked.","Found myself casually perusing ornamental rugs when I came across this beauty and decided to pull the trigger. So far Im really satisfied with the purchase. It looks good, feels better, and welcomes my wrist home every day. 10/10 for the money. I would trust this mousepad in my family home.","This was a good short story,and a great deal of action in it. Although most people don't know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it.","My son used this for approx. 5 months and it's got holes on the bottom fabric and sides (in various places). I would not spend $100 on a product that doesn't even last. Disappointed.","I returned to this product","So so pipe, low quality and it hits funny. Wouldn't recommend it.","Great pump but the gauge is waaaaaay off","Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it\u2019s a fun book!","Simple enough, thin enough... but using the flash sometimes bleeds into the transparent plastic and glares it back into the camera lens... That's the only big problem with this, but in terms of protection? Top notch.","I\u2019ve only been using it for a week and the silicone is already ripped on the side of some keys. The durability is not good.","It was advertised as cotton but was not, sure it was rayon. Also ran small and very see through","The shirt is OK quality, but the sleeves are so tight I don't know how it could be comfortable for anyone.","These had good flavor. I wish they'd leave the nuts out. Very dry","My 1st HDMI switch. Tried it and it wouldn't detect that my PS4 Pro was 4K. Later on the HDMI ports stopped working. Tried different HDMI cables and they still would not work. Not sure if I just got a defective one or if this is how it normally works. Guess I'll be trying a different HDMI switch.","If you are looking for a pillow to help balance your back this is NOT it!","Never could get it to work","These leak. I thought it was me at first, but nope. These definitely leak. The soft ring is in place, the lid is screwed tight, the flip top is secured down. Still leaks. I put my smoothie in a plastic zip bag so it won't get all over, which ends up wasteful.","Great quality but too big","This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf","Not good quality and fit small","Feels pleasant and leaves skin soft, but no visible lifting. Not worth the cost.","These glasses are huge and they don't fit properly. They want to charge shipping to return them so I guess I'll try and give them away. Bad purchase.","These boot run a little large on the size 10w. I would buy again just as a 9.5 or even a 9","Fragile handle with care","Tiny little out of the way quick charger up side is both USB docks are fast charge not one lower & light is not near as irritating while driving at night","The only reason I had to buy a new charger was cause my old one had the rubber broken off the cord and it was a hazard to keep around my baby. I had that charger for 4 years. I got this one and it lasted 1 year and it was giving me small problems a 4 months after having it.","Very easy to install. No hassle at all.","I was looking more of a bath pillow...pillow if that makes any sense but, this is not the product for it, I see that many people were happy when I was browsing, but it was for me","Very pretty design. I was looking to replace my cloth placemats because I was honestly tired of washing them! These are VERY thin. I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn\u2019t think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I\u2019m not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper! But they look pretty and easy to wipe clean so I\u2019ll see how the durability rates as I put them to use.","Is okay but too hard to get cards out. If you have alot of cards and you push and try to fan them out sometimes cards go flying. would be better without money clip. Elastic for cash would be better.","I love this product but one of the bottles we received does not spray correctly and we had to throw it out. Otherwise, the smell is awesome and great for making smells disappear quickly.","It's listed as a three pack, but it's only 2.","I use it to support my neck while I sleep, because I can't sleep on pillows.","The great thing about this is the POE power supply directly from the DVR saving you a ton of work. You only have to mount the cameras and run the wires (supplied) plug them up and start your settings. I can view my 4 home cameras from ANYWHERE on my cell phone or lap top! It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!! You just scan the bar code symbol and poof, like magic you can see all of your cameras. I give the total package a 9 out of 10. I DO recommend this system.","Shoe is okay loose fit, somewhat comfortable.","It tastes like it hasn\u2019t been sifted. Other brands taste cleaner and better. I can hardly stomach this. Great benefits to my body but it gags me.","One if pictures shown in advertisements shows an ink pad. I assumed it came with it. I didn't. Now I am driving all over town trying to find a green ink pad.","I never received my order. I reached out to the company twice with no response. Very poor customer service.","I haven\u2019t had my Apple Watch protective case that I purchased seems to be fine. I haven\u2019t had it very long. But, so far no complaints.","Perfect fit, nice design, good quality for the price :-)","Came well packaged. Super easy to use. Love how big the caps are. But no recipe book! Don\u2019t advertise it if you aren\u2019t going to send it!! I kind of want a few bucks back just for misleading me!","Fit over my 8mm wires with 90 degree boots on each end. They did however turn black when only slightly touching headers....","Professionally built I\u2019ll be mounting tomorrow.","Worthless, tech support does not even answer back. Not working. Do not buy.","Easy to carry around, set up and fold up. It takes less than 2 min to set it up. Now i don't need to carry those heavy umbrella and chairs to the beach.","there was too much shifting scenes to follow the individual chapters.","This made a nice addition to the wrestling theme of my Grandson's Easter basket!","Does not work at all. Came and does not look like the picture. Fits my husband did not even try on any of my kids as where you would hook up the medicine cup is positioned very wrong.","I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery\u2019s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.","The taste is strange, Stick with the orange mango","The ball appears to be durable but the pump is tedious. It is a plastic hand pump and it is difficult to pup enough air to make it full and then quickly remove the pump and insert the stopper. An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.","It looks nice but it is only facial quality. The rubber tips bend very easily. The wood is cheap wood. And the molly screws broke in my wall and made gigantic holes. So now I have to spackle, paint and redo the whole process which should have been 5 min to do. The molly screws they give are cheap and are WAY too big. Use your own tools for this and you should be fine and it will look nice.","I would not recommend buying if you have narrow feet.","I received two wraps and both are latex free. The description says contains latex. They are not nearly as sticky as the latex versions. Beware!","Package was delivered to wrong address. My neighbor brought it to me.","I have wanted a pair of Penny Loafers for a long time. Haven't worn them since High School but have had my eye on them for a while. Great quality and fit. One of my favorite purchases.","Works super well. Also works great for other tough cleaning jobs like dried up flour/dough.","I don't really like this aloe gel. I don't like how it smells and texture (very liquid, no like a gel).","Cheesey, so much internal dialogue it bacame whiny, and when she tried to stand up to her father she sounded like a whiny child, she admits it, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant to read. Oh, the cheesey parts were with the cult, too ridiculous to be funny.","It works and the mirror flip is great!","Why doesn't everyone have these!!!??? THEY ARE AWESOME!!","This is what you will get ,it s nothing like the photos they have Very disappointed and I don't know how Amazon can back up like those people never order from them check my photos and compare I through it in the trash","Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it\u2019s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn\u2019t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.","Great Product Great Seller","Never received the item","The laces could have been better quality","Used it on my Mahogany kitchen counter and it really made it dull and didnt seem to leave much of a protective coat vs other Tung oils Ive used.","I stuck this on my friend's car. Its a clean cut! very nice","Bought as a gift, but didnt work. By the time given, return window passed. Boo!","Liked- My cat liked it, after getting over being scared of it, Dislike- Feather fell apart One toy was broken when I received it, Chirping noise did not work Definitely returning it.","Came in perfect condition.","This series always makes me laugh. Easy reading when you just want a break from everyday life.","Easy to use and install Works well in diffusing light I use it with a Nikon speed flash and it gives me nice options for controlling light especially with portraits. Have not used it long enough to comment on durability.","I couldn't get into this book at all.","The white color is nice. Very easy to set up. Got this for an arts and crafts table.","Pen is really small and uncomfortable and there aren't any other options available for this tablet. I need a small tablet to do remote work in cafes etc. and the Pro model, even the small one, is WAY to big. Going to return and try a Huion I guess.","Nice coloring book except the pages are not in numerical order and are placed in the book to where some of the mandala's are on the right page, others on the left and in some places both left and right pages are blank. But for the price it works for what it was purchased for - quiet time of coloring.","They are boxers that fit,and the cover as they are supposed to. Ne'er vice was excellent!","Got it for my wife. She had supply issues. This helped her to boost supply. We buy 1 every month. Good Stuff!!","Lots of items and options for the price, seems to work well.","Great quality for the price. If you know how to convert them to HID even better.","They smell weird, and are very thin. But I got them for our arch. Hoping they are going to work. Won't know till o go check with the venue. Nice for the price tho.","It was a small medium I'd say. Go a size up for baggier fit.","We got this for my son who loves to look at bugs. This is a great magnifying glass for little kids as it is solid and has a soft grip so little hands wont drop it.","Handy bag. Fits ladies' shoes easily and also able to fit large men's shoes.","I never received the darn thing","Using this product to spread acrylic paint on my canvas","the instructions that came with it were terrible","Great condition, great movie! Disc wasn\u2019t scratched at all, and the box was perfect.","I bought the kitchen shears for preparing chicken for Asian dishes. We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.","My daughter really likes the design and colors on this product. It\u2019s easy to hole and drink from. However, it seems to get too much air inside of it- tons of air bubbles. I also don\u2019t like how water gets trapped between the bottle and the handles. If I had a you get child, I wouldn\u2019t use it at all because of all of the air it takes in.","Product was available very quickly. Very nice color. Thinner than I expected.","Quality is not good.","A more than impressive manual. Bought it to learn the fundamentals of Powershell for my job needs and it definitely helped me master the basics through lots of examples and clear explanations. If you're looking to master PS this guide is worth buying","the panels open up sideways making it almost impossible to frame around it, very disappointed.","This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren\u2019t really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn\u2019t be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!","The story capture my attention and the tempo of the story is well organized.","Nice comfortable shoe. Does have wiggle room but, unfortunately, so does the heel. The straps err on the side of too much give which makes the shoe bed too loose. Sad to say but they must be returned. Bye bye cool shoe...","The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.","When I bought this last week I didn't realize it is a \"kit\" which you have to put together yourself. I thought the product was ready to use upon opening the package. That being said, I still haven't used this product and I am thinking of sending it back.","The rings are very bulky and dig into my toes. I can't really wear them while walking around.","Two of 3 units failed within a few weeks on the carriage lights on my garage.","I installed the fan (Second one ordered) and I had to start it with my finger, as it would only move a couple of CMs when first powered up. After turning the blade with my finger and letting it run for an hour, it would then start by itself. It does not instill a feeling of confidence in the product. Their fans are usually top quality.","It's soft and the price was good, but for this particular pillow pet (butterfly), it came apart at a seam during only the 2nd wash and got fuzz EVERYWHERE in our washer (and eventually the dryer as all the clothes covered in fuzz dried out). I stitched it together so we'll see how it goes. If this was my first experience it would be 1 star... but 3 stars because this size pillow pet is great for my daughter at preschool and the unicorn we previously had held up for two years of constant use and washing before it finally got lost/stolen.","no good did not fit, I cut ir a bit to make it fir . worked ok for about 3 day and everything was gone","Sorry! This does not work! Can I send it back? It is useless!","Watery texture. Immediately caused severe itching upon first application. I had to wash it off after 5 minutes.","Never delivered they refunded the money though","Nice and light to wear for summer.","Cheap quality. Break easily","My dentist recommended these tuft brushes to help clean the deep grooves in my chewing teeth (molars). Most regular toothbrushes and even electric tooth brushes do not reach deep enough, which led me to have lots of cavities. It also is great for reaching behind my back most teeth. I use both regular tooth brushes and this brush to clean my deep grooved molars. So glad I found these in economic 3 packs, so worth it...","I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.","There are some reason for 5 stars: -- It's small and lightweight, easy to carry anywhere bcs of it's retractable design. -- Only one cord I need when indeed in charging bcs of it's 3-in-1 design. -- Must value of money there as received 2pcs in one package. -- Fast charge and data sync as there are no any difference in charge and transfer data with my original cord. -- Promptly arrived as arrived within one week. All in one, good quality and convenient.","This cover fits my CharBroil grill but its loose and sloppy. The fabric is very flimsy unlike my previous grill cover which was stiffer and held its shape. this one touches the ground when its on the grill and leaves dirty marks on the top of the grill which i dont know if they will come off now.","A dislike it being all crust open the only thing I like that you had plastic secured to secured on the inside but I'm not happy","Love this stand. I am a teacher (computers) so I need to be moving around the classroom while demonstrating with a projector. So my laptop needs to move with me. This has a shelf for the remote & even storage on the bottom.","So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.","Ordered these as stocking stuffers, but 3 of the figures are poorly made (i.e. have scratches, incomplete painting, etc.) Luckily I only need 8, but 75% is not a good record.","iOttie has created better cell Phone holders in the past. This one does not stay on air vent wing and keeps sleeping off while driving for prolonged periods. On top of that shipping was delayed extensively even though it stated it was in stock and was considered a Prime Benefit item. On the plus side it does hold the iPhoneX with an Otter Defense box.","the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.","Really disappointed with what I received. The label says it is compatible with the Bialetti Mini Express. The gasket I have is on it\u2019s absolute last leg. The pictures above show the size differences.

He says this machine is suitable and perfect for everyday use this summer, he surprised at how quickly it started to make ice cubes.","So I purchased this thing in May (2018) and used it maybe 3 times since purchase. Well today I needed it and had it set for 51 inch lbs. On the 2nd bolt it 'popped' and the ratchet now spins free. Complete waste of money. \"get what you pay for\" is totally accurate in this case. Stay AWAY.","Received Bathtub Drain Hole Hair Catcher Drain. Can't return with the policy on this item. Please be aware!","It was a trial for me. Not really my type of book. I would read others.

Very low quality of fabric looks untidy.","It's small and a little difficult to read. I would have liked larger text.","These cards don't make sense. The \"Thank you\" has nothing to do with the cartoons on the cards. Several of the cards were misprinted and the cartoon was cut off. I returned them as a result. I'm glad they were misprinted so that I didn't have to keep them. Because of the cartoons, they should be blank inside, not say \"Thank You\"","These silicone straws are amazing!! I got one for me and my son. I love how they have their own carrying case and cleaning brush for on the go. I take it with me everywhere and use it with all my drinks. I am so glad I found these straws.","If I could give this 0 stars I would. When I received this, it came with 1/4 full only.

It works much better after using this product.","I had bought this in Oct 2016, by mid 2017, they had already become quite soft, and by end of 2017, they had almost flattened.. Certainly not worth the current price.","Poor support, back portion dug into my achilles heel tendon","It installs easy. Kit includes everything. Works with no leaks. Just know that the blast stream is definitely tight and concentrated. So much so that if you turn the pressure too far you could potentially hurt yourself. I recommend turning the control dial slowly up to the point it is going to get uncomfortable. You could use a sharpy to mark where is the \"sweet spot\" pressure point is. A couple other tips are: 1. Use paper to wipe off the initial heavy. 2. Check your wash job with a clean piece of paper to make sure you got it all.","Never even received them so I can\u2019t tell if they are worth your time or not... they weren\u2019t anything but a WASTE of my time since they never showed and we needed them for our daughter\u2019s haunted maze that she put on for the neighborhood kids on Halloween... \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","Well made product and the little magnet was pure genius.

Only after 1 month of light-use (2-3 hours a week), it started degrading. The grip of the strings started to loosen up and no matter how many times you tighten it up it always loosens immediately on playing and causing a weird tone while strumming. That is not how a good guitar should function!","Definitely recommend. Great to have back ups for my kids ipads. I have been used a lots of cables, This is my favorite. General line is too short, I like to lay on bed playing with mobile phone when charging, Always bent. This line solves this problem. Very convenient. And the quality is also very good! Excellent quality cable at a very good price. Great purchase. Arrived quickly & works as expected.","The boar bristle brush is so well made. The quality exceeded my expectations. The comb, travel bag and head band were a perfect touch. Thank you !","Ever since I got this phone, I\u2019ve had nothing but trouble in activating the phone. Apparently, the SIM card I received was compatible with Verizon which is not my carrier. After giving me the run around, I was told I needed to buy a T-mobil SIM card. I couldn\u2019t find one locally so I ordered it from Amazon. Two days later, I called Tracfone back to finally activate my new phone and was informed that this new SIM card was still no good. This time around they offered to send me one free of charge. Now, it\u2019s a week later and I have a phone I can\u2019t use. Grrrr..... I can\u2019t understand why Tracfone doesn\u2019t ask you which network is compatible with you phone and send you the correct SIM card BEFORE shipping the phone. My hope is that I\u2019ll receive the correct SIM and get my phone activated once and for all. Otherwise, I\u2019ll send it back.","Item was way to Small","As described. Fast service.","Bought the pedal exerciser for my 87 yr old mother. She loves it and although she is active - even still mows her own lawn, she likes using it when she is inside when the weather is rainy or cool. She liked the fact it was assembled except for the tension knob so she was able to use it right out of the box.","I like the clear cup because it allows you to see the tea strength and I loved the top because it holds the tea bag and it can be used to drain the liquid out of the tea bag. However after the 3rd time I used the tea cup tea leaked into the lining of the cup and can no longer be used, very disappointing.","Second one for second vehicle. First one works fine. Item is a bit pricey but there is no arguing the external quality. The longevity of the circuits only time will tell","My husband loves this product!","When I charge two of the same type of device but use different cables, the Native Union cable takes 3 times as long to charge the same item with approximately the same amount of battery life remaining. I contacted the seller and they never replied. Do not recommend purchase of this item. I have a similar style by another manufacturer and it still works like a champ 4 years later.","fairly sturdy. dip bar a little high.","More of a dress than a tunic. Not built for rapid walking.","Sizing chart was inaccurate. Too large for my child and also very wide in general. They threw in surprise arm floaties, so that was nice..... just would have rather had a proper fighting jacket and no floaties. Took a long time to ship.","Package was opened and delivered with bashed in packaging.","Can't tell you if this item is good because it never showed up! Already 4 day past delivery date and had to get other ones before the game.

However, when you get used to that it is good.","If the stakes are wooden. These things are like dull saw blades ripping their way through the meat. NOT sharp. Returned and very disappointed. Handles are nice. Know that these are made in China.","This box is nice looking, but it's not very functional. Once you get halfway through the box of tissues, it becomes very difficult to access the remaining ones. Much more decorative than it is function for sure.","We bought 4 packs of 10. They are cute! Shipping was quick. However, I'm a little disappointed as to each pack has 50% with the same images, and 1 pack has only 1 pink and the rest are blue. These are how they were packed, and I just put all the faces up to show.","Not sure what was wrong with this moisturizer but since I started using this moisturizer, my face was more oily than it was before and I seen more pimple pop up. After a week of using this, I throw it away. This does seem to be a good moisturizer but maybe it is not for my face type.","Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.","So I bought this fan for a trip to europe which I'm leaving for tomorrow. Lots of the places I'll be staying there won't have air conditioning so I thought this little fan would be the perfect thing. I don't know if the fan I received is defective or what. I put in brand new batteries and could hardly feel any air coming out even with the stupid thing three inches from my face. Then when I tried to take out the batteries, the plastic cover broke and a little metal piece fell off of the battery holder. Seriously don't buy this fan, I'm warning you. You'll just have to throw it away and go out last minute to find one that works!","Unit works good in grass, age appropriate, easy to operate. Design flaw...Have to unscrew battery compartment disconnect low quality connector which will break with repeated use, pull out battery pack to recharge. Unit is slightly overpriced for this reason, otherwise new out of box has been fun. Hopefully it will last, but not confident with connection for battery.","We've been using this to treat IBS and leaky gut, as well as get gut flora back into optimal range after years of medications. Over time we have noticed a huge improvement in regularity and cramps. Very much worth trying!","I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..","The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.","Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged","Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these. They are completely secure. It took a little practice to remove them (use your fingers, not your fingernails, and practice a few times before you put them on) but they are great.","My 4 year old loves MARIO and the adjustability is good, ranges to fit anyone head comfortably. Would purchase again.","Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.","I\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house! Picture of front door where it was left is not our front door?!?!","Easy to use and lightweight","Its a good computer but i had a defective battery that was not detecting!!!","Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.","Just got this yesterday, love it. Put it in air fluff dryer with 3 tennis balls. Did not want to wash right away as others suggest. This bag has better loft than a custom made Top Quilt I bought. Love the colors. Love that head and foot ends cinch up. I close the foot end and use as top quilt. Had a slight odor. I put a dryer sheet in hammock with bag. All good now. This was shipped UPS and they left package at another house. UPS did not follow up with their investigation of where package delivered; so I had to go hunting for it all over neighborhood. Love the USPS. UPS, I have had problems. Just an FYI.","Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.","Hard to use for my 5 & 3 year old. They know how to work FaceTime easily but this app is a little more difficult","Only giving 3 starts because it\u2019s not very sturdy it kind of wiggles when you move it, but if you leave it alone, it\u2019s works very well and very cute. Tool me about 30 minutes to install by myself.","Very thin and even more fragile. The only good thing about them is that they were definitely strong.","Woohoo now this story just throw me for a whole new meaning of being daddy's little girl I for once don't want to mess with Daddy he is just so over the top of a lovely papa that I want one of my own.

HIGHLY recommend!","My family and I love these. When I received these, I was wondering why they were in baggies, and not packaged like the picture on Amazon. It looked like they were opened and they put them in the baggies to sell them. Oh well, I am not sure that I will order these again.","I looked around for a few weeks for a GOOD tongue jack for my enclosed trailer. I finally settled on this one which was one of the most expensive ones out there. I don\u2019t mind paying for quality. After opening and installing this jack it worked for about 10 seconds and then quit. It didn\u2019t even let all the way down to the ground before burning up. I do not recommend this jack to anyone. Buy a cheap one and take your chances.","This worked out really well for me. I was consistently getting 90 pumps or water out of the 5 ml size bottle. That is not a typo. Ninety.","I didn't order a case for a iPhone I don't have that phone","Thrilled that it has no aluminum, but does nothing to prevent underarm body odor after sweating.","They're okay but the light swath could be much wider. A little disappointed.","It does not secure to your ear once you start sweating in the gym or especially running. Do not buy this garbage.","Sleek design, very light. Love it.","Didn\u2019t have much luck using them.","Too big for my wrist! (I\u2019m female, early 30s, 5.5\u201d and average body complexity). And it is also too big for my mom\u2019s wrist. I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don\u2019t offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.","These earrings are darling and so lightweight! They go with so many different outfits and are just the right size! I absolutely love them!","gift receiver really pleased","My sensory child hates flavored toothpaste. This really has zero flavor and smell. It foams up a tiny bit, if this is an issue, so I had to run the toothpaste under a little water for my kid.","These candles burn nicely and do not drip. They are also very pale and do not smell like beeswax or at least the ones I get from my local Farmer's Market. My Bee Guy's candles are also cheaper and burn a little longer.","Works well, it's not very sturdy, but handle carefully. So far, no problems but I clamp the heater lightly.","The mirrors are very good and fit nicely, however installation is very challenging due to the difficult location of the bolts and nuts. Also the instructions are a pathetic excuse and virtually unusable. Find a YouTube video to see how to actually mount the mirrors. K","Very cheap craftsmanship. Poor sewing and flimsy materials. Returning immediately as it will probably quickly fall apart it's made so poorly.

Also wish they would just slide in and out easier - every time I put the water one back in I would slop water as it was hard to click it without doing so.","I did a lot of shopping around and decided on this light because it was the cheapest of the ones with the features I wanted.

Too many pages that don't have any kind of meaning for me. The very last page had a small drawing I enlarged and copied. The intricate drawing is what I like about Celtic drawings.

The menu Is not easy or simple to operate.","I pre ordered this book because I really like the first few books. This one however is a total let down. This is a fictional story and the trashy political jabs should have been left out. The story would be just fine without the author interjecting her personal political views.

It\u2019s a great product, however, you can\u2019t increase the degree between keyboard and screen more than 45-50 degrees or the laptop will tilt back a little due to the weight.","Works great easy to use.","Gray remains beautiful. It would have been a better movie had her role been larger. Actually, it would have been a better movie had anything at all been done differently.","4.5 Stars for Lie With Me I love the Stonewall Investigation series and have from the very beginning. I was so glad that author Max Walker didn't stop the series but opened up more offices across the nation and spending time in Miami with the boys. Loved Oliver and Beckham together. I have to say I was shocked at the twist at the end, for the life of me never expected it. That's what I enjoy about reading a Max Walker book, the suspense, mystery and the romance. This is the trifecta for a good read!","Smells wonderful!! Lasts for hours.","I bought a pair of these back in August and have been using them every day at work. They make a world of difference for me, and if I forget them at home one day my eyes really feel it. Most people in the office thought they were real, prescription glasses and were surprised to find out I got them off Amazon purely for staring at the computer screen. I've never had an issue with the quality or anything like that. I'm actually planning on buying another pair to keep at home.","I ordered a size 8 and it fitted true to size. The shoe is cute and very light. The rubber soles are nice for walking around the office. It has minimal cushion support, I suggest getting an insert if you plan on being on your feet for a couple hours.","Works great for walls but a little too big for door frames!","You cannot call out side intercoms. Someone has to ring door bell. My issue is i\u2019ve had two unwelcome visitors that I would have liked to communicate before they broke into vehicles. I don\u2019 Know any criminals that will ring door bell first .","Bought this for my teenager and it is way too big. This would fit a Large head.","These are very comfortable, fit well, and don't slip or slide on the floors.","Product did not work out of the box. The wiring was loose and after fixing the loose wiring, product would work during the test but when installed in the ceiling, no response. Tried 3 times to make it work and finally had to go to local Home Depot and buy another fan which worked right away. Trying to return the product to Amazon.","Instead of a pack of 6 bags 40\" long, I was sent one bag 47\" long!","large might fit to size 8 1/2","Not the color I was expecting","I loved the clock really nice but arrived with one of the points broken. Tried to get issue resolved no help from seller. Loved the clock very unique.giving it a one because seller won't get back to me.","Product arrived warped, in turn didn\u2019t function as intended. Would consider something different.","Perfect for traveling - enough room for phone, credit cards and money!","The kit is almost what you need for the nintendo switch except it has no long handled tweezers and that is a must when working on the small circuit boards and electrical ribbons. If looking for a set for your nintendo pass this one up and get one with tweezers","I love the shoes - they are super comfortable. I ordered a size 8 Wide (which I sometimes wear along with size 8) because they didn\u2019t have size 8 and it is a little too big, but I\u2019m going to keep them since I already wore them.","I really love this walker! The only thing I would warn people about is that it does not work on carpet.","Came as described. Quick shipping and daughter loves it","Love the reinforcement edges, just as pretty in person, and the tabs and pages are usable! I think this calendar will work! I do wish it had more note pages and the ability to add pockets (has one) to the binder. It's a go though!","I was so excited to get this rug cause it looked more plush and fluffy than other rugs I\u2019ve seen. This, however, wasn\u2019t the case. It is indeed a very pretty rug but not as soft as I hoped and unfortunately to me, doesn\u2019t have a good feel to it either.","While the box is solid and arrived promptly there was nothing either to attached or already to installed that allows you to hang the files. You know, the reason why I purchased the box","A fun D.D. Warren short story. The problem with short stories is I always want more. Love Lisa Gardner. Enjoy.","RETIRE BEFORE TWENTY-NINE is the great book. i love this book . this book is the great book. i like this book. thanks author.","Very nice sign, love it","It tastes so good. I love putting it in protein shakes but it is really good to mix with water and put on toast.","Quite possibly the ugliest glasses I've ever bought. I returned them because they offered no protection from sunlight.","One didn\u2019t work so sending both back","The rose design is beautiful and it feels great when holding the case, because it's really smooth. But, the quality of the case is subpar. The corners of the case was not properly glued on so the plastic is sticking out and could possibly come off with normal wear and tear. Would not really recommend this case for long term use.","Should furnish Google's. Dangerous to face.","Probably the longest wearing polish I\u2019ve ever tried. Lasts more than 2 weeks on my toes. No chips ! Love it.","As a beginning of a longer story- a bit disappointing. Extremely religious world, the whole gods system unclear, military fractions mixed up. So, the commander of knights , experienced soldier, during many skirmishes and war didn\u2019t kill anyone? Nonsense. The plague concept interesting, let\u2019s see how the author develops it. Dead who are alive - difficult concept, we can\u2019t be even sure who is in and out, for the whole series a threat, as there might be the case, that those killed in the first volume will be back in the third. I\u2019ll buy the second book anyway to see , where it goes.","The mirror was nice but arrived damaged. I couldn't plug the usb cord into the base because the hole was misaligned. returned it for that reason and ordered a different one.","I have fat calves so I ordered a size larger than I needed to accommodate. I don't want to say that the item is somewhat small for that reason. I was well aware that that could be an issue for me. However, I was able to get my fat calves in them with a little work and am largely comfortable in them.","These are really pretty but smaller than I expected. Package next to a roku remote for perspective.","Awe man I really feel bad for writing a poor rewrite as I see some people have really enjoyed this record player. I got it and out of the box I had issues with the tune arm. I could not get it to stop skipping! Every record I tried I couldn\u2019t get the thing balanced, aside from that the speaker quality was worse than a tin can. I\u2019m so disappointed with this experience. I traded this in for an audio technica and the sound quality is night and day, no skipping! Perfectly clear sound from new records as it should be.","Great vinyl, just wish there wasn't a sticker holding it together. The vinyl itself is perfect for projects.","I received this item and was quite pleased with it. I would not hesitate to purchase another.","It is too sharp but its haft was been flaky after just a month.","It\u2019s just ok for me. I bought it because I thought the towel will dry my wet hair and I don\u2019t need to use hairdryer anymore. Well, I still need to use hairdryer to completely dry my hair.","It's very easy to put on and is comfortable to wear. I just wish I could pull it a little tighter in order to possibly speed up the process.","I am very pleased with the camera, it was easy to install and connecting to the network was simple. I use it to keep an eye on our pets outside and it has been reliable and I have had no problem connecting to it from my iphone","perfect for meal replacement shakes - a little thicker than regular straws but not too thick.","I knocked this tape down 2 stars because it doesn't stick to my skin very well. I have to wrap my thumbs a few times to get it to stick and then during my workout it rolls over itself or loosens more. I really like how flexible the tape is but wish it would stick better.","Not impressed by photo selection. Image quality is generally poor. Anybody can muse on someone else\u2019s photos.","So a dead battery 4 months in.... I have watches that are 5+ years running on the same battery, and this thing couldn't make it 1/2 a year. They should run for at least a year or they should be replaced free of charge.","This book caused me to do as lot of introspection and make quite a few adjustments. EXTREMELY instrumental in freeing up my time and allowing me to focus on the important an not the urgent.","Tug of war, just chewing, and fetch are the usual activities the tire is used for. Likes it better than his puppy kong.","Smaller than it looks","I usually wear 7.5 but I order 8w and it is small","Faster than expected delivery and exactly as ordered! Would definitely use this seller again!","Length is perfect but the sizing is so inconsistent! I bought two pairs to try on, 26, and 27. But the 27 is tighter than 26! And it\u2019s literally an inch smaller...","My husband really wanted this book. I looked and found it here at a great price. He's very happy with it.","I got this for my 4 year old can be a little slow at charging but she loves it good price good product","Excellent all around seasoning.....love it on everything I make.","Love them. Exactly what I needed. Highly recommend...","We ordered 5 boxes and got a wad of vacuum bags stuffed into a USPS envelope that was literally bursting at the seams.","Grandson loved it had great time at party","It does the job of coping the slides to the chip but it's a laborious process. Each slide has to be inserted into a holder and then inserted in the viewer. We hooked it up to the TV so we could both view the slide without having to look over each others shoulder. That went well, as long you have an extra HDMI port on your TV. The quality color is adequate for most slides, but if the slide has poor exposure, this device will only make it worst. The left to right and top to bottom buttons work well and are convenient.","I bought these for my grandsons! They love them!","My musical tree came with no music box and no blanket. Description says otherwise. Waiting on replacement.","The s-pen that it came with didn't work so I had to order a new one.","smells great and my heels are smoother","I bought this because I needed a small soft sided cooler that did not leak. It does that well enough thanks to the hard plastic liner. I've used it once a week for the past 3 weeks. It already has some damage because the zipper tends to get stuck on the flexible inner liner. It does not hold ice overnight.","Beautiful statue. Didn't ship with the legs.","Product arrived damaged the entire case was completely cracked and smashed in though this isn\u2019t the sellers fault it wasn\u2019t the greatest experience especially after I found out I could have purchased this for the same price at my local Best Buy","The ring holder is gorgeous to look at but not very functional. The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings. I also didn't realize how challenging it would be to grab silver jewelry from a silver tray. Glass ring holders are easier for this reason. Still, it's really beautiful to look at.","I use them strictly for walking every morning so it's a bit too early for an honest review. So far so good. Good fit and all.","Went together quite easily. Perfect size. Shelves a little flimsy, but they'll work.","The new recipe is disgusting. I have been buying these for 7 years and will never again. Chalky, artificial tasting. Please go back to the original recipe","Too small for most cell phones","is wrong one for my vehicle but yet I can't return it and get a refund due to I have to pay shipping back for returning product and be charged return shipping fees what good does that do me to return it when will cost almost same as if I just kept the thing ate the loss....","Started to work in minutes...i could see the fleas fall off my cat.","I was excited and they seemed nice (though I meant to order something much smaller), but then I pulled the bottom container off and the edge was cracked and broken.","I loved this necklace and got a TON of compliments on it! However, after owning it for less than 2 months, it broke. The tassel part broke off where it is soldered to the ring. I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful piece of jewelry and so versatile! I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.","120 Quart cooler is pretty big. The picture shows 3 stainless hinges and the product I received TWICE only has 2. I do not believe that 2 hinges will keep the lid from warping or the seal required so I returned them. The price is good and the Amazon service was good, but the picture does not accurately reflect the product shipped.","Tastes like burnt french fries. I don't recommend. I wouldn't buy, they are hard and taste like burnt cheese. The also arrived in pieces and crumbled, hardly any actual squares.","We have a select number king split bed. I'm not happy with this bed bridge because it's not very wide. We can't strap our mattresses together because each side is operated individually. The bridge falls into the split in the middle which then doesn't really serve the purpose its supposed to. I guess its better than nothing.","Is working just like it said my wort is slowly disappearing","This is a very thin protective case with a VERY thin bumper cover. Disappointed with purchase","I bought 2 pairs of these pants and they are great! Very comfortable and they fit very well in all the right places.","My friend is a Great Baker and loves horror movies. When I saw this apron I just had to get it. Of course he loves it.","This is a stunning table and perfect for spring and summer patio furniture. Everything folds to store in the garage during the winter. The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people. Giving it 4 stars because it was a total pain in the rear to put together, and the instructions were awful (no words, and minimal photos). If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.","Bought this as a gift and immediately gave it to my mom because we were so excited. Was I embarrassed. The hammock itself was okay so far after inspection, but all the straps and extra cords were tethered already. We couldnt even set it up because they looked so badly worn already. Now we have to order new straps and get some new cords to hold the net up.","I wish this was on a watch list for all teenagers. Gripping moving and so real. I was totally moved by thhis film.","Arrived promptly, all printed info correct. Unable to figure out how to adjust to fit wrist. Returned and given prompt, no hassle refund.","The Carburetor matched up fine for the motor. The throttle and choke arms were not installed, and would not connect to the existing links. I had to use the old arms to make it work. At the same time the Pressure washer now is always at full throttle and will not idle down.","Very nice pair of reading glasses. They came packaged in a sturdy box and the lenses were wrapped in a cling type plastic. They hold exceptionally well when looking straight down. They don\u2019t squeeze your head and the rubber grips on the earpiece really help keep them in place. I will buy these again when it\u2019s time.","Received a larger size than what I originally ordered. Too big in the chest area.","Construction quality seems good, but i do not always get sugar out of it when dispenser is tipped over. Unfortunately, i am shopping for a traditional dispenser now.","Got it tried to charge it and it didnt work","If you're a Perry fan, this is a killer CD. The harmonies on 'You Better Wait' are IN-sane. There's a lot of heart and soul poured into this album....from the poignant 'Missing You', to his implied apology to former Journey bandmates in 'Anyway'. Definitely recommend this CD!","Love the comfort of these!!","But for my dogs 30 and 50 pounds they need the bigger size. they ate this not chew.","Had to seal the lens gaps in several places that water was passing through","Sensivity of the tablet is not high enough. It works fine otherwise.","This was a huge disappointment! I ordered it for my daughter to take when she moved to NYC. We knew it would be a little while before she could get a real bed and wanted her to be able to use this in the meantime. It did not fully inflate nor did it hold air!","I didn't like the product that much","Was a good product until one of the bands just broke only had a few days","Excellent. Nice big cleaning towel that works great.","Every now and then, I get cracked fingertips. I wash my hands a lot and, perhaps, don't apply lotion enough. These gloves are like magic! I put lotion on at bedtime and slip these on. In the morning - voila! My hands are nice and soft and the ends not sore and dry anymore. I look forward to using these into the wintertime and experiencing such relief!","Do not take the advice of other customers and order a size larger. Order your regular American size...","This has no problem pretty much gluing itself to the pergo floor, but no matter what type of rug I have tried, they all slide around on top of it which completely defeats the purpose. Waste of money.","I thought it was great.... until I found it was missing pages in April right when I needed to schedule my appointments! It only went up to April 13th then straight to May. Who knows if there are more pages missing. I wish I had noticed this when I could still return it. I suggest if you do buy this planner, go through EVERY MONTH and make sure there are no pages missing.","I bought the queen size and it hardly covers just past corners of bed, basically sits on top of mattress. Are you sure you sent a queen, the package says queen, but it's small.","It was broken when it arrived","Beautiful piece, in a nice felt bag with drawstring. Love it!","When I bought expensive furniture, the store recommended this polish. So did a friend who is an interior designer. I have now been using it on fine furniture for about 5 years. It does a nice job and does not leave build-up. Fairly expensive, so you might want to use it on just the good stuff.","It does exactly what I wanted like a deep tissue massage... Very happy 5 Stars....","The charger port cover doesn't fit into the port","The plastic on this product is to soft on the hook area and has no hold for any object that you hang with it.","The shoes were priced low for a reason, the shoes barely lasted a month.","I like smelling and the safety even my bichon Ari lick it it doesn't harm to her but I don't think her facial became really white though. My puppy doesn't have tear stain anyways. I use it for my bichon ari's on face only.","order once just does not work for me .","The vibration is a bit loud but I like the spontaneous play at home or in public. The vibration speeds are average. Overall decent by if u r just looking for a little tease","I purchased these water bottles in 25oz green for travelling internationally. Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)","This is a very short movie, a kind of \"Who dunnit?\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)","Yes yes yes!!!! My daughter loves it and it is a great size!!!!!","I have had it for less than 2 months and water is sprinkling along the hose","The product was used with her new waffle maker","This pin is awesome! It's exactly what I was looking for.","Easy to put up and work great.","Not quite like frying in oil but without the mess and expense of oil. Certainly healthier. But be prepared to adjust your recipes and taste, and you will be thrilled with results. I returned an oil fryer and got this instead. Much happier with this large greaseless device that is more like a baker than a fryer.","I like the community sprite, continued peeks into the family of Bliss. Great to see the new plot unfold. It never appears as you would expect.","I never received the product. Delivered to the wrong address. And there's no way to contact the seller. Don't buy this.","I bought these for my daughter last year, the addition and subtraction were great! But I just pulled the multiplication out to start and half the cards are missing or duplicates. For example, there are three 5x10 cards in a row but no other 5 multiplication tables. Really dissapointed, because I can no longer return.","I think this is much clearer than the projector I bought before I like this very much","Froth made quickly using cold or warm half and half. No place to store both mixers in handle.","Just like every charger I've ever bought, they only fast charge for the first few weeks.","This was a gift for a friend, and he loves it! He sends me a picture every time he uses it and it is so cute!","Perfect for me....but i received broke on one wrist side. Send this back ask for return nerver receive return back..very disappoint...","This case is okay. I does protect my tablet. The body seems well made and not flimsy. There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus. The case fits my Fire HD 8 Tablet, but the inside 'frame' opening is off center, so one side of the tablet face is a bit covered and there isn't room inside the case to shift the table over.","Love at first sight! Amazing how quickly one can fall in love, across the room he sees her & it's over from that point on. It's not easy, but a way is found! Jace & Bethany find their way to forever after!","It's not wooden material which was misleading as when purchased, it wasn't written anywhere on the page stating the material and the caption was \"wood\". The steam is too weak to be used as humidifier. After 1 month using it, it gave a long beep sound when trying to turn on, after the beep it will not turn on so I have to unplug to reset it. This happens often.","Uncomfortable design, can never get it to fit just right. And after working in it a few hours it becomes almost unbearable. Might want to try the full back brace before this.","Product came missing hooks very disappointed","The foil piece doesn't work well at all. And for some reason one week after buying it i changes the head and it didnt work at all. Im very disappointed in this product.","don\u2019t care for the smell of the product","Glue and paint inside the pipe. That's a no from me, but at least it makes for a good prop.","Beautiful dress! I'm 5'7 and 140 pounds. I ordered a small for a tighter fit, but it was still a little loose.","too many items to check","I would have given this skirt 5 stars but both pockets had holes in them. Otherwise, nice fit (I am a size 10-12, ordered a Large) and great length.","Gloves look ok, but arrived defective on both hands","Looks ok considering the price. Started out so pretty, after less than a week of daily wearing, the metal turned copper color. Not enjoyable to wear. Save up your dollar bills for a nicer ring.","I love how the table feels with this on it!","It's exactly what is needed. Does what it's supposed to do.","Enjoyed the detectives. Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series","I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.","Sizes are not accurate","This item is only made of plastic. I have other ice packs that have a soft fabric on one side, eliminating the need to place a \"towel\" next to your skin, as instructed by this one. I wanted to return it, but was not allowed to.","The clip of this starter is terrible and seems like the wrong size most of the time. The entire assembly has fallen apart several times as the tube threading below the battery also seems too loose. The charger plug is simply a 1/8\u201d headphone jack with a hex soldered to it, which broke off after a few times and had to be resoldered after being cut apart. Really unimpressive quality overall - i doubt it will last.","My daughter bought this as pjs but also ended up wearing as a Halloween costume. She loves it!","I really like Tough Headwear's products but I was disappointed with my beige beanie. The beanie is not at all beige. At best, the color is a warm gray. I am satisfied with all of the other colors I ordered (light gray, pink, maroon, army green, dark gray, black, and white) and if I could give them all a separate rating, all would get a 5 out of 5 stars.","I was missing the letter D, which upset me very much! but I didn't want to give 1 star cause I was able to decorate using the other letters and it came out cute! They are really delicate! you have to insert the straw VERY CAREFULLY! 1 small tear ruins the balloons, obviously! :(","I kinda knew when I got this book that it was going to be a sweet romance, which honestly, is rarely my cup of tea. That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.","Had surgery recently and I learned some of the PT exercises. It meets the same standards as the ones provided at the gym.","Grandbaby loves them. Pefect for his size!","Nice case, but I can't use it. It does not fit my Samsung S6 Active. And it isn't returnable.","The stakes don't work in sand.","No it ripped the same day I got it , I want another one.","The design of the shirt feels very cheap. The lettering started cracking after being worn once.","If you're marketing a sports logo item the logo should at least be visible on the front of the item.","The top pouch is starting to come undone. Is there anything that can be done?","The robe is great. Good quality on the cloth itself. The horns are cheap, they don\u2019t hold up. And the cord was not included. If the cord was included I would have given one star more. Would have given 5 stars if everything was included and the horns were not cheap material.","They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.","Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.","Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.","Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel. I broke off a bolt inside the frame where the sway bar attached and had to weld a rivet nut to the frame. Just be aware when installing.","The fitting was not comfortable and the mask was heavy.","Nose-Pad Arm Breaks Easy. Where's The Guarantee. I liked the product but how does one return to ThinOptics without a hassle.","no suprises really, and multiple spelling errors. Good enough to finish, but easy enough to walk away from too. Glad it was a free book.","Car is amazing, assembly is complete. It is fast and flexible when driving. If you are looking for a fast and I mean fast racing style truck, this is it...... Come on! You would not want to missing it.","Some of these smell good and others smell kind of 'ok'. They cause a strong allergy response and causes my nose to burn and other times cause a headache. I stopped using them.","Seems like authentic ink!","Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime. Directions say to turn the top one way to open, but my bottle opens the other way. It took me 4 days trying to open the bottle until I tried the other way. I will probably purchase again.","fits a little loose around tops. but great colors","Not bad for a small assortment of flies for a fast trip, have to make sure there isn't any material protruding outside of the case.","Was able to get it to work once and then it never worked afterward. Shame nintendo is so greedy with their \"official\" dock.","We purchased these radios to use in our care facility for communication purposes and HIPPA compliance. This is the list of issues that my staff have reported: Lots of static, picking up conversations outside of our facility, very hard to hear, some of the ear pieces do not work (staff cannot hear through them) microphones not working, radio volume not working (can barely hear with some of them). Very hit and miss with these radios. Need something more reliable that works consistently.","I thought this was from DEe Zee. This is not Dee Zee. It is a cheap knock-off. The hydraulic arm is so tight it is now a nuisance to wait till the tailgate lowers. It even took my whole body weight and channel locks to pull it out long enough to install from the truckbed to the tailgate. I would never buy this again. In fact I\u2019m returning it and I just installed it.","Very good sturdy thick soft towels.","The book is loaded with useful info to form a new coaching habit! 4 star is because I don\u2019t like the structure of how the book is organized. Like any habit book, if you don\u2019t practice it, you won\u2019t improve.","This fits like a true plus size. I sit right between a 20 and 22, and the 22 fits...ok. The shorts seem low in the back. I'm used to high-waisted swimsuits, so I keep wanting to pull these higher. The mesh lining is poor quality and oddly attached only on the front of the shorts. Worst of all, the outline of your bits 'n pieces are visible through the shorts! I cannot emphasize this enough. It's cameltoe city with these! It's a bummer, because I like the length and fit of these shorts otherwise.","Never received it or refund.","They look and feel great but it does pull your hair on your arm a lot making it so you can not ware them","I had one of the digital gauges from the '80s. Was still working till a friend borrowed it and drove off with it on the trunk only to be destroyed. A good friend would have replaced it. But good friends and good tire gauges are hard to find. So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.","Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply. I did have to use tweezers because I have long nails. It was very sticky on its own. But would recommend using clear lash glue for the extra hold.","It works really well. Its sturdy so it can take punishment but its hard to clean up the mess but all around a great product.","It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.","One of these works fine, the other will not be recognized by my phone.","after just snapping the bracelet once it split open, the inside is a cheap sharp pieces of tape measures.","I like how it helps stand-up. I don't like how to put them on. They don't really help with the knee problem i have. I've only worn them once and look forward to wearing them under and on top of my pants. It's just a little hot now.","Pros : cost, obviously. This is a cheap item but it still works as it\u2019s supposed to. Cons : only one temp setting, hot. So you will need high heat oil / spray etc or it will burn your grease for the waffle and it will taste nasty.","No. Just no. This stuff is thick and cakey....and yes I just put on a few dots. Do not use this if you have any wrinkles because it will settle right in them and make you look older. I gave it 2 stars because the shade was great. The coverage is okay but not worth the definition of my wrinkles.","Seller sending spam to my email...Never will buy from again.","they sure aint what they used to be when i was a kid","This item was damaged. The description wasn't even what it explained it to be. It was supposed to be a gift. Very disappointed.","Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I\u2019ve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring. The colors are definitely a bit more neon than I would have thought, but that\u2019s fine! They do their job of easily distinguishing my keys.","I ordered it 1 size up and it still is a bit tight. I like my shirts to fit a bit looser. But it is a cute top and looks just like the picture.","I\u2019ve had a few sets of bunk beds for my twins. By far this one has been their favorite. It\u2019s very compact and leaves a lot more room in their room. I got the Black and it\u2019s in great shape. I will say this took my husband a few hours to put together. Lots of parts!! The ladder going up was my only issue. The metal hurts my daughter\u2019s feet climbing up/down. I tried a few different things to make it better and then I found my saving grace. A mega pool noodle!! Not just an ordinary one, mega. I cut one precisely and was able to get it perfect! Now she can climb up and down with out it hurting her feet!","Did not work for long and it is very small, when it did work at first it barely did anything to keep us warm","Items lid does not fit top of can. Can Feels half used. Very disappointed.","Works great and I'm still learning how to clean my griddle.","We got some stick-on Magic Sliders and after a few days they started coming off the chairs. After reattaching them a few times, all the glue was gone and they became worthless. If they stayed adhered to the chair legs they would be fine. They slide OK. You are probably better off getting felt pads which will also come off in time, but are a lot cheaper.","I have a spectra 1 pump and it fits in the bag but won\u2019t zip. I\u2019m fine with this as I will only be using it to take my pump to my parents when I visit and possibly to work if I\u2019m still pumping after 12 weeks. It will work for what I need it to but it is small.","Hi, I am loving the drone and it's features. However, one of the batteries that came with the drone is not charging. How can I have that sorted out?","it's still in wraps, but looks like a quality toy from the looks of things.","The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.","My dog is 2 lb. but still looks good on her! Not too big.","I saw it in a review and said what the heck... and low and behold its kinda annoying but I'm going to see if I can get used to it. Otherwise, it's a great mouse. Software is easy to use but you do need to map the buttons.","Broke after a year. Disappointing.","What I do like about this chicken is it always smells so fresh when opening the package. However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry. I think it's the gel absorbent pads they include in the packaging, it probably sucks all of the juice out of the chicken because I don't have that same problem with brands that don't use those pads. I'll stick to chicken that is vacuum-sealed.","My daughter loves her fairy house kit! It has held up nicely in our garden.","Smells great! You don't need to use very much and it's good as a setting spray.","so far so good! easy set up! Gave it 3 stars because it's not really Red! It is more of an orange color! I wanted Red....they could have went darker","Got good news and bad news. Good news is that thia was a cheap product and came on time. Bad news is that its not that great it money worth spent. Theres a reason why its cheap. Just brought a 4k ips uhd tv amd needed a 4k hdmi cable. Just a week in of using it. Thia product kept cutting out the video for reason. And switched it with a 4k hdmi cable from xbox one x and havent had no problems.","Beautiful, as all their pieces are, in my humble opinion.","Plugged and play didn\u2019t have to calibrate went together easy shipped early","Girlfriend completely Loved it! Makes her Macbook look amazing!!","Ok, update to my review... after only 15 months one of the Lasfit bulbs began to flicker on and off. Very disappointing. I was extremely satisfied with the Lasfit headlamps I purchased. A very good value (price was affordable), easy installation (a have a Toyota FJ Cruiser) and great customer support. I recommend Lasfit over the plethora of competitors! The lights produce clean white beams of light, much better than my original factory incandescent bulbs.","It's super cut but a bad fit. Got the Xsmall. However, it's adjustable around the girth but no adjustment for the neck.","I returned the product. The Q&A said it would work fora rug on top of carpeting as well s hard flooring. It did not.","Like the product. Needed security for my Kindle Fire","Flickers when connected to a dimmer switch. Will also flicker if used where the temperature is low.","Made me sicker than a dog","Cute toy. Comes with batteries! 9 month old niece loved it.","Lower on me then I needed. Sits about an inch below my belly. Lace is pretty but it rolls down. Would be better if they were high waist.","While wider than I expected they will be perfect for a short cruise and pattern quite fun.","looked frumpy on me since I'm 5'2'' and gave it to my granddaughter who's a little taller, she seems to like wearing it with leggings.","My computer is without an external CD player. I bought this external DVD player / burner that does the work, without external power supply because there is only one cable, and especially that is recognized and recognizes all my cd / dvd read or write It works fine. compact. so far, so good. Perfect for the money. Very sensitive, do not touch or move when you burn a CD, and there is no noise during burning. It is worth buying.Reasonable price I saw.Recommend.","Seems to be of decent quality just with the fitment was better.","Mounts crooked. Nothing you can do will make it flush and flat. Wish I could get my money back or one that actually works correctly. Not happy wish I could do 0 stars","I haven't used yet. I bought this for an up coming trip to the Dominican. It appears to be built very well but I have not used yet.","Stopped taking a charge after a month. Just blinks red after days of trying to charge it.","It's beautiful, and the quality is very good.","I already buy this but, found it cheaper through here. I love that I don't have to keep buying little boxes in the store ( usually comes with 6) this is a better quantity for me. I eat this in the morning before leaving to work and it holds me good. I recommend this product.","Suppose to be good quality. My pup had the stuffing ripped out the next day. Bummer","Comfy like what I expect from Crocs shoes--can easily wear for 4-6 hours. But as they day goes on & my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants & jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps & backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.","I wanted to keep this swimsuit but it ended up being too small. I wasn't comfortable in it and didn't feel confident. I ended up returning it. I'm 5'5\", 135 lbs, 34D - ordered a Large","I liked this kit a lot, I gave it to my daughter who babysits, and everyone joined in to paint rocks.","This game is fun and not crazy difficult but not super easy either!","For the price, it is good adjustable height ironing board. It does, however, wobbles somewhat because it is light weight. I only iron when I sew (hemming, etc) so it will work fine.","Not ideal for thick hair. It will hold a small french twist if you have a chin length bob but anything longer requires two.","It's a good sturdy item but the issue I have with it is that your feet are to uncomfortably close together to use at the same time","I planted my herb garden in this but had to take a few out as they weren\u2019t doing good. The front middle of each pocket seems to hang and so the water isn\u2019t distributed evenly. Still looks cool.","It's cool but huge and heavy. Like outdoor iron gate pieces on jewelry . Might be your cup of tea.","if you close the drawers all.the way-they are extremely difficult to open again","Very nice case - guys well, good protection","My little one said it is uncomfortable and we have a standard round toilet seat and the training seat would not fit it in!!!!","I was looking forward to taking Mastic Gum. My package arrived. No plastic Seal around the cap and the bottle was open. Wasted time and money. Do not order from them. Get them from somewhere else.","The bag with the hoes was wrinkled and not sealed.A nozzle was attached to the hose.","The texture is great, but this pepperoni is lacking in flavor. I was expecting a bit more spice and herbs. I would rather pick up some pre-sliced mass produced pepperoni from the store.","I ordered a ton of cables for my production studio set up and these cables are well made and for the most part work great. The only problems I've faced is when using them for my audio interface. They have issues and start causing data drops or glitching. Switched cables everything was great.","Thought I was getting votive holders because of the picture but instead got votive candles. Yikes. I do notice it's in the description now that it's too late. The candles are ok but I don't need them.","Very nice knife. Much better than I expected. Fast shipping","As a mattress, it works well for my daughter, but it's been 2 months and the mattress still smells.","These little catheters really help. No gripe water or gas drops will help as this product. My baby sleeps better now.","These are travel size.","This set is absolutely the most beautiful in person than on the website! Very soft to touch but sustainable. And it's wash & dry!","The only problem I have with it is that the stand-up mechanism isn't that stable and we can't adjust the angle.","Right shoe was wider than left.","Helped me adapt a sim card for my hotspot","hi I received the case but it doesn't fit on my lap top,its too big ......can I return it for a smaller size","In the picture this dress looks loose and flowy. Even though it is only 5% spandex it clings to the body. The material is cheap and see through. I would not recommend this dress unless you are looking for fitted dress. Which I was not.","The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit. Thankfully it fit perfectly. Unfortunately the zipper gets stuck so bad. Last night I need help to get the zipper up, today no one can get the zipper up. It's not a size issue it's just the zipper. Ruins the look if the zipper doesn't zip!","I was a little disappointed in the quality of these. The magnets work well and the size fits with the other name brand ones I have but the plastic is definitely thinner than the name brand ones. Overall good buy for the price!","Loved the result but hair see dry","IT IS FINE, NO OTHER COMMENT TO MAKE AS IT WAS SIMPLY A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I SMASHED AT MY DAUGHTER'S HOME.","I am really disappointed with the light output and these are not \"extremely bright.\" I have white LED headlights and I thought that the yellow would contrast and fill in side areas not covered by the headlights. All I see are yellow highlights to each side of the headlight beam. Switch them off and there is barely a difference. To be fair I didn't have opportunity to try these in fog. I'm not sure how you rate longevity but these will probably last forever! Not that it makes much difference since they don't really do much, unlike the OEM lights that they replaced before one go them blew. Perhaps I should have bought the white.","If you like Devin you\u2019ll love it, if you\u2019re new to heavy Devi this is a great place to start.","Works ok decent product","Leaks brushes stain easily","We've had this thing for a long while now. I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.","The band was great until the stitching started to come undone after about 20 days.","Very cute. Quality not the best as the tie began to rip on my second wear. Also it is more robe like as it only ties. Easy to fix with a safety pin.","Out of 12 ornaments 6 were cracked. I guess the 6 functional ones are going to work well for what I need them for haven\u2019t tried yet. Just opened package.","Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.","Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.","for the price it didnt work very good so i sent it back","The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!","I bought this product for when I\u2019m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.","When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!","I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.","The calendar came damaged almost like a scratch on one of the dates. Not a huge deal but kind of a bummer since this wasn't exactly the cheapest calendar I could have purchased on amazon .","Oh my gosh! I hot to see my grand niece in her little outfit yesterday and I think it is the cutest thing ever! The sizing was perfect and the colors, bright and cheery! Her momma loves it and she received many compliments on it. Well made and beautiful fabrics.","My jar tasted like my grandfathers old milking barn smelled. I could not use this.","Totally love this! Very pretty! I\u2019ve seen these years ago and when I found this on Amazon I ordered right away!","It was not what I wanted.","Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.","The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.","I had new sod put in over the summer. I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!","Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat. My dog is not allowed on the couch but just rubbing up against it and the static from this fabric attracts so much white fur. A fine cover, I\u2019d say, for a house with no animals.","My uncle loved the shirt i got it for him material is perfect and tank you seller","It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.","The shoe fits great but feels thin on the sole. But for the money, it's great. Guessing pro soccer players wouldn't be using this but for what I need it for, it works.","I don\u2019t think this got very hot and felt very heavy.","This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.","This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.","..fine to use for light snacks","The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside. My son tried to use his rake to move some dirt around in our raised bed garden and it bent where the tool meets the stake - eventually breaking completely after that. The pieces are fairly flimsy and it is pretty small even for my 2 year old.","Dominos didn\u2019t fit in the slots. Had to return.","This part arrived today not very happy by the quality of this product it\u2019s made very cheap for the price. Will probably be corroded in about 2weeks. I expect to be changing this part very soon","The material is thin and transparent. The threading is already loose prior to wear. They are comfortable otherwise.","Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone","Replacing previous pair that lasted two years and would\u2019ve lasted longer if hubby didn\u2019t where them as slide on slippers at times. These are a good purchase. Heavy duty, made to last, keep feet dry. Comfortable too!","Just felt lose like it was going to fall apart easily.","said juicer / blender - there is no juicer component","SO EASY! I love it! First time with hard floors and I just grab this and sweep up stuff - it works well and is lightweight.","Very good read. Keep me entertained an wanting to come back for more. Vrry intriguing. Loved the storyline an Talon.","I like the color of the bag but the look of the bag could be a little more stylish. Overall, the bag provides enough storage space for all the necessities.","Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.","Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.","I bought this twice. And returned it twice. It arrived with the glass broken in multiple pieces. What's wrong with your shipping department, Amazon???? I'm not the only one who has returned this item because it arrived broken. Please learn how to properly wrap, mark and ship fragile glass. SO DISAPPOINTED!","Does this camera have to be on a HD dvr","Instructions were sometimes difficult to understand, but given it was our very first time trying a murder mystery it was fun. We will do again - hoping for better results now that we (somewhat) know what we\u2019re doing.","Remote stopped working already. Bought new batteries thinking that was the issue but just more money down the drain.","These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I\u2019m impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.","Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.","It\u2019s nice but very disappointed on the way it was packaged, small box in a bigger box, no styrofoam packaging and came opened up in box just flopping around. Hope it works or I\u2019ll be calling for a refund. Thank You!","The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.","Blackout curtains so much better than they used to be. These are a decent size and texture. Perfect length.","There is only one and for the price you can find others online that cone with 2. Very disappointed since the photos show 2.","It didn\u2019t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn\u2019t show in the picture","These are well made, super cute & a great size","I use this for hiking and open water swimming in mountain lakes. The product is well built. It is fairly heavy material. It is very important to have it fully inflated or it drags when you swim. That is why I am giving it three stars.","Water these for my cat was disappointed when recived product had a hole in each side of thumb of glove","It doesn't fit good with the phone, in does not stick in the sides","Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.","Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.","Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere","I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.","Being my first product like this I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\u2019s a decent toy.","Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it.

There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.","Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.","I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.","The scent is more masculine.

In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover.

However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.","(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports.

In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.","I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket.

The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.","Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.","I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better.

Fell apart.","Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.","Smells good and keeps the bugs away","I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.","Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again","I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \"indoor\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)","Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.","It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old","Exceedingly fake-looking.","Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.","There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.","The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids","I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","It\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off","Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt. Way too much money for the size it is. It looks flat.","Exactly what I wanted! I have 3 cams outside. They are under sheds, so cannot talk about how weatherproof they are. But they, for sure, look nice.","This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item! My family and I totally loved it!","But definitely order 1 size large then most, very cheap fabric, but it\u2019s being used for a costume so will do","only for indoor application. if you have no lip on the inside, it has to go on the outside. the magnets dont stick tightly at all, big gaps especially corners where insects will come in. i do not recommend.","Battery did not power up my watch .","Works great for my Deebot!","The only thing I didnt like was that the pointy part of the velcro is too thick and I'm constantly afraid it might poke my baby. I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.","The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.","Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.","Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.","Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2\" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5\" range instead of stopping at 3\". Still a handy tool though.","OK, but crumbly and stale.","Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since","I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.","I have an older mule that I use for riding 4 or 5 times a week and I love it. This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding","One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty","brass fittings very thin","This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.","This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!","For the price it\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider","As promised...it works!","A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.","Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy. Buttons are flimsy and toy does not always react fast to the commands. The main positive is that the toy is sturdy.","Too big for my Christmas tree... is good material but too big.","Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.","Works great in the bright florida sun.","I love this case it fits perfect for my Mac Pro 15 inch, the cover is soft and the design is nice. Love that it comes with a screen protector, it does bubble up a bit","It is easy to use & it works. Have only used it once.","Chipped wood when it arrived","I have not burned my old chair yet. I\u2019m sure the new chair it will fit & look good.","This kit is designed too small ,and the location is too high for the phone to place on ,I can see only half the screen.","Dissapointing product","Great idea and format, but lacks answers to exercises. The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).","Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!","I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade. You must be careful or you can nick or cut a pet easily. Probably a great tool for professionals or experienced groomers or if your pet stays fairly still when trimming.","wait and see how it works this winter","Perfect for what i needed it for ...","Very inconsistent in connection.","Received a completely plain white t shirt!","very hard and uncomfortable.","Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.","I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.","Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \u201cclean out\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!"],"topic":["14: my but use not water for product","-1: outlier","0: size fit could top ordered dress larger","-1: outlier","-1: outlier","11: box

<p>In this visual, the topics are clustered together - which makes sense, because the method for creating visual and topics is consistent. Interestingly, when looking at clusters of outliers that are located near each other in the chart, we can see common theme - I wonder why these were tagged as outliers?</p>

<p>Let's now turn to a classic approach - LDA, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We will not review the theory or the inner workings of this algorithm here. The key difference vs. BERTopic is that each text (document) is considered to be a composition of topics. We don't cluster documents into topics, but instead discover abstract topics that are represented in a document corpus. For each document, we get the probability distribution over these topics.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we have discovered three topics: sports, data science, competition.</p>
<p>A document that is about data science competition might have the following distribution: <em>sports: 0.05, data science: 0.5, competition: 0.045</em>.</p>
<p>A document that talks about world championship in cricket migth have the following distribution instead: <em>sports: 0.54, data science: 0.01, competition: 0.45</em>.</p>
<p>There seem to be many implementations of the LDA algorithm, and some of them result in significantly worse results. It also seems that the Mallet implementation is considered one of the best ones, so we will use it here.</p>
<p>To speed things up, I will use the first 10.000 reviews for topic modeling. I will only display 1000 reviews in the t-sne chart.</p>

Looks great on my desk.","Broke down after a month's use!!","Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module","Nice looks like picture","Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it! Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!","I\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.","Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure","Item was not sealed and was missing parts","There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.","Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.","It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.","Buy this light. For the price you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing.","Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can't help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila.","This was never received...","Stitching came undone immediately. Already took tags off so couldn't return. Disappointed.","Seems to be working for my older dog. The vet recommended this brand.","The USB was configured incorrectly to fit into my 2016 Hyundai Sonata. When I turned it over so that the USB would connect, the audio connector was on the wrong side. Won't work at all!","Have not received over a month ago I ordered this","Only gave one because couldn\u2019t leave no stars. This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it\u2019s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either","Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.","Great prices and props for my photo booth company.","I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn\u2019t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I\u2019ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.","Its perfect for my purpose, its lite weight is perfect, and so soft and warm. I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.","When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this","The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.","unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!","It's a fast charger but it doesn't charge the phone as fast as my plug in. It's nice but a fast cord charger is better.","Perfect Christmas gift for my sister! She loved them. The bands are very difficult to change!","The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.","Some of the designs are hard to recognize.","Sadly, the pages were alllllll but 3 riped from the book. I wanted to return it but I was involved in a car accident and was unable to. But I\u2019m disappointed that it was sent out in that condition.","Not very powerful. Noisy.","Beautiful shoes but rhinestone fall off. Found two and replaced them with glue but have lost some permanently. Still like the shoes.","Nice color. My cabinet looks like new.","It\u2019s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\u2019m off my feet because I don\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else","Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.","Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.","Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.","Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.","Did not charge my psp well at all","Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.","Have not used this because we cannot figure this out","Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!","Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced. I checked the local Ace hardware store, thinking it would have to be cheaper, but the flapper on Amazon was actually three bucks cheaper.","Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.","Stick well, peel easy and stay on the wall. Exactly what I was hoping for my nursery. We had painted the walls and no damage done.","the hinge broke after one year - not even a year of heavy use.","That's make me cough be better","I have long, fine hair. These are hard to put in & pull my hair when I take them out.","A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.","Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\u2019s a Jeep and we\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\u2019t chipped, I\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).","We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.","Too big for my face. Look good & packages good!! Quick delivery!","It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!","Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.","I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars","From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.","I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.","I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are. It is tight on the calves and arms.","It was a nice product over all but trimmer Broke after a month.","4/5 from a satisfied customer. I saw a similar product advertised on Facebook and searched for it on Amazon. This was the same product I saw and cheaper. It performs as its supposed to. Unfortunately the size of the glove is too big for my hand.","Product only lasted probably 10hrs before shorting out. Used it in bass amp for concerts. Would definitely purchase professional quality next time.","This is not for kids. Horrible. Bloody shark swimming around saying it will of into your room and you will meet your doom. Who approved this and rated it as G?!","Great case overall, it's very hard and protects the phone very well. Only thing I dislike a little is the buttons are a bit hard to press, but you get used to over time.","never really worked. unable to get it to work..","Product as discribed, cracks very easily though. Seems cheap","The company sent me another one as the first bracelet broke in a few days, well this is bracelet number 2 delivered on Monday and broke in the same spot. The quality is just not up to par. I have reached out to the seller because I do in fact need a bracelet that is reliable","I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly","Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient","My bird family that lives in our back yard loved this bird food. They are flying in from the neighborhood. Thank you for providing nourishment and joy to my family of birds.","Granddaughter loved it, she\u2019s into anything strawberry!","Warm and dry. Good fit around ankle for support.","Pretty decent and sharp but the middle section gets stuck sometimes...kinda annoying","Great bag... just wish it had an extra pocket inside.","Loved it..... a gift that I did not think I would use.... I was wrong. It is great!","I dislike the fit it\u2019s very cheep wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone","My son really wanted this hoodie so when it arrived he was pleased. It is very thin however and there were several loose threads. The style is neat and different. For the price I was expecting something a little bit better quality however.","Its o.k. but not as thick as another brand I previously used. I think the other brand lasted longer in my hair for the day.","Ordered for my son who is deployed and he loved it!! He said it was the perfect pre workout!","Just what the doctor ordered. Love the flexibility and range of temperatures.","I wish I could give 5 stars. As far as the glasses go, I absolutely love them. But three glasses arrived completely shattered","They are sticky but probably because of the heat -- they were in the mail box and we had high temps in AR","Helpful on my trip to the UK. The computer chargeing ports are a nice extra","Bought these to cycle through a newly bought shotgun. Did not jam.","We received this today. It's beautiful. Love the shiny chrome. Easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. Just needed to open up the battery compartment to add six AA batteries and the liquid hand soap. Screwed in the three screws and placed it on our bathroom wall. Works like a charm!","It made it so much easier to rotate my inside plants!","Solid construction. Not as flimsy as the other inexpensive type C cords out there.","This is a well-made, very attractive alarm. I received an outdated instructions sheet so when I emailed the company with a question, I received immediate, helpful response. I\u2019m very impressed with this company.","Not easy to use at all","I thought i was receiving two dog jackets. As shown in the picture. I only received the red coat. Picture is misleading and i am disappointed. I am a frequent buyer from amazon. Very disappointed, misleading with the picture above.","It was ok needs jewellery to make it look great.","Spring is not easy to use. The other items are great","This is my second one from Oh La La Cheri because it fits perfectly, is actually open crotch in the right spot, is comfortable and made well enough to last a while. My fianc\u00e9 loves it.","Ink smudges every 2 inches on right edge of paper, all copies , not quality I need to be sending to clients, learned my lesson , 14 $ for two cartridges , will go back to others I ordered that worked fine, pay a little more , get it done right the first time","worst smells like chemicals I hate it never bought powder worst than this afraid to use and get an acne","I have never ordered this brand but heard great things, not sure if those brown areas are normal or not","They\u2019re great, durable and fit well. I do recommend setting them outdoors to air out for a few days until you put them in your car.","These show with every pair of shoes I have tried then with. They have seams on the toes which make them uncomfortable.","These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.","For some reason, I bought these to ride my bike with in the cold. They suck for that. Not bad for just walking around, though. I didn't know they were touchscreen compatible til I saw the description again, so I can't comment on how well they work on a cellphone.","The size was off, I usually wear a lrg. or x-lrg. But this was snug I wanted to order larger but was sold out.","Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.","Great product. Delivered timely.","This fascinator looked cute when I did not move, but it was too heavy to stay in place. I used the clip on the headband, but the whole thing kept falling forward on my forehead. At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)","Nice pair of leggings. Very comfortable. I haven\u2019t wash them yet but they seem safe. If not, I\u2019ll update.","Horrible tool. Went to loosen a bolt and the head of the tool broke.","I purchased this item to use for my sons prom send off, the only balloons that were able to be used were the latex ones, no foil balloons could be used, also the discription shows a 2018, I was sent a 2019, which means the day of prom last minute I had to go and purchase the correct numbers which cost me an extra 40 dollars... I'm so disappointed..","Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.","Very good toy. Very tuff to.","2 of my markers were dry. The f Green and purple markers were completely dry. Unsatisfactory","Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library before buying this book. Wish I had. Trust your gut instinct. That's it. Nothing more.","I like them because sometimes you order thing that are not the size they say. these are large the size they say love them.","Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18\" long 1/2\" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2\" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2\" angle iron, each 15\" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.","Much smaller than anticipated, the picture looks like it\u2019s a man\u2019s bracelet when in reality it\u2019s more for a woman. The clasp is impossible to use one handed making it impossible to put on alone, must have help. I will be returning and not recommending this to anyone.","Very nice keepsake box, Purchased for a gift.","I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.","best buy is at Costco or Smith&Final","I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.","The shot glasses are all scratched up. Poor quality. Will not but again.","The antelope color is not the same as I expected it to be. Looks different online.","looks better in person than online. somewhat hard to tighten the band by yourself, also can be uncomfortable if you tighten too much since it is not a flexible band.","The top was a bit tight and I'm a 36 B. I got a medium. I prob would still wear top but underboob is inevitable since the straps are not adjustable. Otherwise the top was cute. Bottoms fit weird and where the strappy parts are on each side the inner lining (tan/white material) showed no matter what and looked super odd. Not cute at all. Maybe I am just too wide for them. I have a 26\" waist. Def for SHORT PETITE people.","These are inedible. I am a health food freak and I have tried many products over the years that have been awful tasting but this tops the cake. I have never tasted a cough drop so disgusting in my life","The product just work a few days, and broken.","I gave this mascara 2 stars, because I would love to use it; although I cannot. The wand is in very poor condition, the brush fibers are falling off and are crushed. For $28 I am very, very disappointed. It did not appear in great, new condition when it arrived.","I am vision impaired and thought this tape would highlight places I need to see. I left it in the sun for a day, applied it, and hoped for the best. Result? Nothing. I can tell the tape is there only by feeling.","This chair is fine. It's a little too rolly, also it doesn't recline unless you pull the lever, which is a little weird but I guess I get it. Okay chair--you get what you pay for.","Very happy with my purchase. It was an excellent price, and the product was just as described, Looks great in my home theater!","Purchased this and one week later it failed. Cannot reach Polycom for replacement. Returning to Amazon as defective.","This was a gift for my grandson. He was so disappointed because there were no lights or sounds as it said on the box. The drill only turned one way. Not happy with it at all.","I bought two chairs and was super excited to put them together. These are definitely cute and are nice quality. The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the \u201cneck\u201d piece, the other didn\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don\u2019t screw them in as far, you\u2019re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.","Great quality for a reasonable price. I used this at a baby shower I hosted and everyone was impressed! SO pretty!!","I loved this book!! Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty's best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own. The fantasy world is beautifully detailed with magic and tension and tenderness throughout.","Got this for my 7 year old. He loves police officers and this puppet was the perfect size for him. Gives him hours of enjoyment too. This was shipped out fast and very well made. I highly recommend.","I bought this a little over three months ago, and while I thought it was a good bag up until now, the bag's strap snapped as I picked it up while leaving the gym. I'd recommend this bag if you need something on the cheaper side but I'm not sure if just my bag is like this or if this is routine.","Lasted a whopping two weeks before it ripped with minimal usage of my AirPods. Not worth the money but too late to return. On the plus size, it was easy to install and looked really nice before it ripped. Maybe I got a bad batch?","I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!","Bought as a new one, but it was used! Verry disappointed!","Nunchuck plug doesn't fit well.. and falls apart upon removal. Also loses sync with wii frequently.","Update: Its ok diaper cream. It separates very easily and it does have a very ROSE LIKE smell. I am still going to use it but not sure I will keep using this brand. I prefer the Target and Walmart brand better so far.","So soft. Just watch the stitching","Works well. So do real cameras :) would buy again.","Overall product is well constructed, Holds a charge well 2 or 3 uses before recharging. The fit is well for me and my wife however,the range is only about 4 tractor trailer lengths away before losing contact and the sound quality is not what I expected for what I paid...its not a packed crisp sound...but more or less a crackly weak sound, not a bad product , I just want the reader to know what yo expect before you spend over 300.00 like I did expecting a little more.","It's a decent hat for the price. For me, the stitching was odd so the hat looked cheaply made. But that's just me, I'm quite picky. Overall it's a decent hat for the price.","Just got the case and it\u2019s too small. What the heck??? Anyone else had this problem???","I use this product in my bedroom which is facing south with too much sunlight. This curtain works well blocking the sunlight. And the price is good.","I used these strips for accent lighting behind my PC monitor and under the shelf that it sits on. Very easy to install and operate. The instructions are very clear for setup and couldn\u2019t have been easier to follow. I wish I could find one or two more of the extension/connector cables by themselves that match what\u2019s in the package so I can put these strips in different places for various lighting, but I guess I\u2019ll have to stick with what I have.","I really want to give this suit a 5 star but I can\u2019t. The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size. It all fits there but the cup size in a xxl looks as if it is a triple d or a double d. I am a larger girl being 249 but my chest is smaller. Would love to exchange sizes but cant find anywhere to message sender.","I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light.","Is OK but runs small","Our son loves this costume, I don\u2019t, necessarily because the picture online makes it appear to be a shiny and body fitting costume but it is not. The shiny part is actually white designs and not necessarily body fitting. It is padded which I do like.","I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don\u2019t have something underneath. They are good quality though.","i loved it! it came in great condition as well","I just wish it would save the names.","The leash was good before it ripped. My dog is 45 pounds, order the medium, she is strong and pulls sometimes, but is not a persistent puller. The leash ripped and is no longer usable after 4 months...","I have lots of problems with this rice cooker because the liquid often steams out and the rice doesn't get enough liquid. There is no hole in the lid to allow some steam out.","wire broke off on inside","i think that says it all .","I read anothers review of this item and agree, the doors are tough to hang straight. Also be careful of the backing screws as in the middle front lower shelf you can see how the screws broke away the bottom shelf. Otherwise its great!","I wasn't so excited to get this float but I will be returning it. Immediately upon inflating it I discovered a large tear in the stitching. The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.","nice gag gift but rather small","Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you\u2019d want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!","Watch came without extra sizing links. Cannot purchase the links without purchasing a new $180 band. Will be returning","They are comfortable except hard to get used to with the controls ..... buttons in odd places","Was a baby shower gift that was on the baby register list. Got a very nice thank you card.","Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read","Feels quality for the price. As advertised.","I like the colors and the staying power of these glosses. A good value for my money. They are a bit sticky so only 4 stars.","Very disappointed with these balloons. One of the big rings came with a hole in it and another two balloons popped as I was filling them with helium.","This doesn\u2019t play well. Pauses in places and will not load the rest of the movie. Could only watch to first 50 mins.","One star because I couldn\u2019t not leave 0. This case does not work, when I did the stress test it worked but when I took it in the water, it was not water proof. This at best is water resistant","Great flavor but not sure if it actually works","The dress had little holes in multiple places, unable to return it, didn\u2019t notice until I wore it and others pointed out the holes! I guess when you buy cheap clothes you get cheap quality!","We ordered a 24 pack and received only a 12 pack","This a great case for the price. It looks great while also providing the protection that I need for my iPhone.","This does seem to extend the length of my manicure but I don't find it the miracle product others do. I get maybe 5-7 days instead of 2-3 out of my polish with this.","I initially purchased this plan to cover a dash cam from defects, accidental damage, ect, but when it came time to file a claim, the company refused to cover my accidental damage claim, and I had to jump through hoops showing them proof of purchase of my insurance plan, because apparently, the insurance plan ID for some reason wasn't enough. I've dealt with asurion before and I've never had problems like this, so insure your purchased Amazon goods at your own risk.","This is a great book so far. I haven't finished it, but I cant wait to! Well worth the great price!","these eyelashes are actually pretty decent if you are looking for a more natural look. they are very lightweight and flexible for easy application, not thick at all.","Excellent product - feels great and very therapeutic. My massage therapist recommended this for reflexology.","I\u2019m disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.","Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.","I have found it really hard to put on magnetic lashes that have 2 magnetic bars per lash. They are difficult to line up both at the same time, and they aren't as long as a realistic lash line. I ended up cutting each lash pairing in half so they are smaller chunks with one magnetic bar per lash set. This is much easier and looks better.","The things I liked most about this product are the attractiveness of it and it's light weight. There are no downsides that I can see.","It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.","I like the color and design of this toaster. It fits perfectly in my kitchen counter top. Bread toasts uniformly and can remove bread crumbles from the bottom tray. I highly Recommend this.","Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.","Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume","I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.","Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.","Since I installed the head, I have noticed a slight vibration. Although it still does the job will","Great info from a history buff","Was amazing for the first 2 weeks, and then my armpits became so irritated that I had to quit using!","Did not receive Entire Order. Called & cancel the part of the order I didn't receive. I was told I would Have a refund & someone would call me. NO calls or contact , or refund at this point & time ??????","Poor finish, Poor fit. Cut my finger on the jagged finish. Holes didn't line up. Shipped back the same day and I had to pay for shipping. BOOO.","I ordered this because I love Cuban coffee that I drink while I\u2019m on Florida. It did not live up to its name. Will not order again.","Nice thick shirt, good quality. No issues with the prints being off. Usually wear XL and the XL size fit perfectly. The design and color are awesome. Would recommend!","This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars","Not the best quality. Some arrived broken.","My baby loves the baby gym. As soon as I lay her down on it her eyes light up with joy and there is a smile from ear to ear. She laughs and giggles and has the best time with it. Honestly, great gift for any mom or great for your own child too. The babies love it! This product is 5 stars","I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I\u2019m rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.","Open the box and discover a top side snap already cracked. I want to give this a chance but wonder about the durability of this product now.","Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy","Very very wide shoes. Only good for babies with extreme foot chub in comparison to foot length. The velcro also doesn't hold well at all. Super cute, though.","They are pretty cool, but don\u2019t drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.","The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height","*** update The handles have worn out and one of them broke off. I still use it but it's no longer as useful. At least it still holds stuff. Original comment: Works great. Durable. I ended up buying 2 of these after having my first. Do wish there was some sort of expandable strap for carrying on shoulder or in one hand. Great product.","Spring clip is too weak, jewelry is easily lost. disappointed","Stopped working after 3rd light yard work. Chain just scrolls. Too late for Amazon return. I liked how lightweight it was.","i never received this item","Hard to get excited about Snap Ring fasteners/washers. I needed two for grocery cart wheel replacement, anyone need the rest ???","We like that it\u2019s insulated and we like that it\u2019s unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don\u2019t know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.","Seems like a good idea but I found I didn\u2019t really need it.","Way too small. I got a large for my 9.5 feet and can't get it on.","While they may be effective if your cat will eat it, mine turned up her nose to these hairball treats.","Great quality glass screen protector. So much better deal than getting it at the cell phone store. The screen is a nice thickness and is super easy to apply. You don't have to mess with any bubbles or anything. Great price and great screen protector!","These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.","I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.","This cookie cutter is so small!","Bought for car, but the base is smaller than the top, so it toppled over very easily. Perfect size, not great execution","Wow, this protein powder can get so fluffy & light! If you are a fan of protein fluff, this is by far the best product! No xantham gum needed!!","Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.","Made my first bars in this today. I ordered it because it was a favorite of Sally's Baking Addiction. This is a high quality pan.","Being African-American, my hair/scalp is naturally dry and I can't wash it more than once a week or it becomes brittle. Maui Moisture is the first shampoo in a long time to help hold the moisture until the next time I can wash my hair. Really happy I found it.","Smaller than I expected !! It will do \ud83d\udc4d","Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.","Came in a box with other items I ordered all of which are fine, but the ceramic casserole was wrapped in a thin bubble wrap which is not sufficient to protecting it. So now, it\u2019s smashed. Do I really have to send back this garbage?","This works fantastic on vinyl .","Do not buy, it will crush your bullets.","Bought these one pulled apart the 1st night used. Another quit 3rd. Time used. Giving 2 to see how the last 2 hold up.","The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn\u2019t explain who was whom very well.","I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.","Not as durable or water resistant. Case pops open every drop","Product is not as described. Not a one+ cable at all. Not even a cheap knock off.","haven\u2019t used the refills yet. Got this as an accompaniment to a tactical pen. Expect it perform nicely","can't say too much about it.. arrived with glass lens broken and had to return","Not an unlocked phone ... a VERIZON phone belonging to someone ... missing accessories.","This is a prob with seller.. I ordered this product Sept. 16, 2019 and ordered two which gave me four balls for the toy which used. 1. I received a pack of two today which I did not order. I never put it on auto order either. I don't want anyone choosing what and when I order my stuff. Now I am chg for this and I may have enough already for the year. The batters will be dead by the time I use the one sent today. What is going other. Never hd any problems with other seller. I am not happy! The balls are wonderful otherwise.","I really like the design of the backpack, but it is not practical for a college student. This is a good backpack to hold maybe 2 books. There\u2019s days where I walk almost 2 miles because of my classes and my back is hurting and aching. It\u2019s a very bulky backpack and doesn\u2019t fit much in it. I have to shove things back in if I take something out. I also cannot have my 15\u201d laptop in it without taking something else out. It also smelled strong of plastic when I first got it. I\u2019m going to be upgrading from this backpack.","I love the product. I feel more energetic after a few weeks of taking this.","I did not like the way they were packaged. There was huge tacks that You had to pull out so it ripped mine","Not one single cable worked! All of them say \u2018the accessory may not be supported.","Easy to assemble and sturdy, light enough to pick up and move, and the speakers sound great. However, this chair is far from comfortable. you sink into the chair for lack of cushion, and you can feel the front board in the chair on the back of your legs. Also, the curve at the lumbar portion of the chair arcs your back and causes pain after a short time. Recommend extra padding/lumbar support if you get this chair.","Too small for my dog","Great handle, 4 stars because it took nearly a month to arrive. Should have read they were coming direct from China.","my granddaughter wears them but the shoe itself is large","Works great took the squeaking out and looks great","I bought two units and overall love the mobile music. Both units were processed the exact same. While listening to them, my second unit's battery only lasted about 20 hours. The first unit still showed full charge! I just downloaded the Monster phone app so going to see how that works later today. Great sound, variable battery life.","Works great. I had this skin tag on my face, I used it multiple times to get rid of my skin tag. I finally got rid of it, it does irritate the surrounding area after using it, make sure you put a medical tape on the tag after applying the solution to minimize redness and irritation. Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, it did exactly what was advertised.","I love this! So many options for fruit teas and water. So easy, it almost makes itself. The lid will strain the fruit as it pours.","Is not what I expected. Memory foam too thin.looks nice.","You will need to pump ut up a lot to get more than a single spray from this. Disappointing but looks nice if you don't mind the extra work.","No assembly was nice. Made in America \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Arrived in open box, one bent stake which I managed to straighten, no packing slip (probably due to completely open box) Perfect addition to the garden. Would purchase again.","Does not even work. wasted my money.","There isnt enough glue to stick it on your eye and make it stay. Not worth the money and it isnt eligible for returns sadly.","This is on my wall of clocks","I only used this swim cap twice a week for two months and it tore. Pretty disappointing since I have the same cap in another color that I have used for a year and a half with no problems. Just wanted a different color.","Lightning plug sunk down in just over a month and the adapter was unable to be repaired.","Fake!! These are fake pens. They do not work!! I ordered these to use as back up to my digital bill detector. I keep a fake $100 in the office of my restaurant to help train staff. It\u2019s a known fake. The digital detector caught the bill so I know it\u2019s fake. These pens show that it\u2019s real!! I have other fake bills used for training staff and it says those are real as well. Come on amazon!! Stop letting people sell fake stuff on here!!","One fits, the other falls off. Poor quality control in the sizing and construction. Soles are hard rubber and sound like dress shoes on hardwood floors, so not very optimal for indoor use.","It take forever for the polish to come off with these pads","Good quality. Comfy.","the loop on the handle broke after a couple of uses.","One of the four bulbs was defective and would not work","OMG...I bought this for my 4 year old grand daughter. It is perfect for the desk we just got her. First of all she can't break it. she can twist and turn it. There is no plug so it is portable...it charges with a USB cord which is provided by the way. The light dims and brighten...can be used as a nightlight also. Lastly,,,it has a pencil holder. It is the cutest light ever. I do recommend","This book was chosen for book club. I was initially interested and then quickly lost interest. I found it hard to follow at times and lost interest quickly. It was hard to finish and I only had about 15 pages left to read before book club and just never had the interest to finish the last pages.....","a little flimsy but doesn't show in presentation. used these for my students water colors for a gallery show. everyone was impressed how nice things look. would recommend for student work.","Well worked great for like 3 days but then started falling apart","Not what it looks like","My kids and grandkids love this item. It is a good transport for sports, picnics, camping, and more for this active family. Th quality of this product is very high; it folds and stores very nicely.","Decent quality jumpers at a good price. Don't put too much strain on these, they're not meant for them. Get a 90deg adapter instead.","I want to see how Kevin lives or dies! And does he fall for his best friend eventually? Lots of twists and turns.","Only giving it three stars because the charger works fine, but I put a screen protector on 3 days ago and it\u2019s already cracked. I don\u2019t do anything ridiculously rough to my watch but it shouldn\u2019t crack after three days.","These r very nice. Big and good quality.","I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.","I bought two sets of them and one set came with the middle diamonds being clear and smaller.","The pens themselves are nice, espcially for the price. However, the ink is terrible. I\u2019ve had these pens for a month and both are struggling to write.","Be careful, the small allen screw that holds the light stripped after adjustment. The company should at least use stronger material screws.","Purchased 8 months ago and both broken now.","Beautiful item but the glass cross was broken in 4 pieces when I opened the box due to no packing material. Needed ASAP for a gift.","This item is exactly what we needed and ordered. It works and is compatible with our i phones.","It looks easier than it is. I ran around trying to fill this thing with air and it took several tries. I looked ridiculous. Finally got enough air in it to make it work. I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner. Not able to get the water out...and worried about mold...it ended up in the trash. Pretty bummed. The idea is great if it had worked for us.","So I thought I would be getting some type of a \"minty orange\" lifesaver....(I wonder why? Look at the name of them!!!) WHen I tried my first one....Nope...NO \"mint\"! It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice \"bright\" flavor over \"Mint\"....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good! Just not \"mints\" as they state....","Slightly off white and loose","Love this dress, I probably should order a smaller size since it is a bit loose in the top and very long on me.","The waist is too high and the bottom too long. I could get away with it but I like my leggings to be be fitted. I might have them altered or I send them back. Not sure yet. Fabric is on the thin size but not see through. Expected for the price. I am 5.2 so I would recommend for taller people! It adjusts well to my size which I am small/medium legging size. Perhaps they could create a petite size!","Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark & seem to be of cheaper quality","I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.","Needed to flash it to get it working with my NVR system (shinobi). Seems to be working now.","Talk about a POS!! I ordered this to replace a broken cover on my iPad. I got this and while putting it on my iPad it BROKE! Super cheap material and I so disappointed with the quality that I put the new and old screen covers in the trash! Don't waste your money as this will just disappoint you.","Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.","This is a great product; however, the powder doesn't blend completely.","Ordered a tinted they shipped me a clear one","I've had a Roomba. It died after several years of hard use. It worked on hard flooring and rugs. This eufy RoboVac is a piece of crap. I'll be returning it. It does not work on floors with rugs even thin low ones. It gets stuck constantly and can't get itself out of it. After this experience I'll buy another Roomba.","The directions that came with the crib for assembly, were completely wrong. It was not as easy to put together as expected. Other than, the crib is great and is good for small spaces.","I love the look and lightness of this wig! The only issue for me is that it does not come with combs or a front lace. However, I purchased a wig grip and it stays in place perfectly! Will buy again!","Loved it soooo much I ordered another set!","Worked great on the first bottles of shampoo & conditioner, when I switched them to the new bottles 1 of them quit working.","I have wavy hair and I thought this would enhance my waves. It did nothing actually and didn't tame the frizz at all. I'm highly disappointed.","Meh. They cut out some noise, but don't make a great seal. Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.","It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.","Light weight, easy to place on your car for mounting your phone. Great for young adults","Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.","I've never used a knife sharpening stone so this was interesting. Sharpened my knives quite well. It has been hard to find something that works in sharpening my kitchen knives, this worked.","so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can \"grab\" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally \"modified\" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.","My son loved it, because he much prefers the xbox control layout over the nintendo switch layout.","As soon as i got this product and one half dont work","I could not get the lights to stay in position. I tried tightening them but got no better results. I wanted to aim them where the light would be best for my seedlings and was not satisfied with the results.","The second day (in a row) we used it, didn't hold the air anymore.","Sadly, it was too small.","The quality is very poor and is not 3000PSI Wast of money RIP OFF","I was disappointed that these were a jersey material with a wired bow design not bandana material. They are a little big for my head but they are cute and comfy.","I,ve used Franklin Covey Planners for over 20 years. I have found them extremely helpful in tracking my work-I,m an attorney. While other attorneys use their phone or an I-Pad as a Calendar I can look up my cases and dates much faster.","they are nice but not as good of a material as i would have liked.","Found myself casually perusing ornamental rugs when I came across this beauty and decided to pull the trigger. So far Im really satisfied with the purchase. It looks good, feels better, and welcomes my wrist home every day. 10/10 for the money. I would trust this mousepad in my family home.","This was a good short story,and a great deal of action in it. Although most people don't know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it.","My son used this for approx. 5 months and it's got holes on the bottom fabric and sides (in various places). I would not spend $100 on a product that doesn't even last. Disappointed.","I returned to this product","So so pipe, low quality and it hits funny. Wouldn't recommend it.","Great pump but the gauge is waaaaaay off","Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it\u2019s a fun book!","Simple enough, thin enough... but using the flash sometimes bleeds into the transparent plastic and glares it back into the camera lens... That's the only big problem with this, but in terms of protection? Top notch.","I\u2019ve only been using it for a week and the silicone is already ripped on the side of some keys. The durability is not good.","It was advertised as cotton but was not, sure it was rayon. Also ran small and very see through","The shirt is OK quality, but the sleeves are so tight I don't know how it could be comfortable for anyone.","These had good flavor. I wish they'd leave the nuts out. Very dry","My 1st HDMI switch. Tried it and it wouldn't detect that my PS4 Pro was 4K. Later on the HDMI ports stopped working. Tried different HDMI cables and they still would not work. Not sure if I just got a defective one or if this is how it normally works. Guess I'll be trying a different HDMI switch.","If you are looking for a pillow to help balance your back this is NOT it!","Never could get it to work","These leak. I thought it was me at first, but nope. These definitely leak. The soft ring is in place, the lid is screwed tight, the flip top is secured down. Still leaks. I put my smoothie in a plastic zip bag so it won't get all over, which ends up wasteful.","Great quality but too big","This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf","Not good quality and fit small","Feels pleasant and leaves skin soft, but no visible lifting. Not worth the cost.","These glasses are huge and they don't fit properly. They want to charge shipping to return them so I guess I'll try and give them away. Bad purchase.","These boot run a little large on the size 10w. I would buy again just as a 9.5 or even a 9","Fragile handle with care","Tiny little out of the way quick charger up side is both USB docks are fast charge not one lower & light is not near as irritating while driving at night","The only reason I had to buy a new charger was cause my old one had the rubber broken off the cord and it was a hazard to keep around my baby. I had that charger for 4 years. I got this one and it lasted 1 year and it was giving me small problems a 4 months after having it.","Very easy to install. No hassle at all.","I was looking more of a bath pillow...pillow if that makes any sense but, this is not the product for it, I see that many people were happy when I was browsing, but it was for me","Very pretty design. I was looking to replace my cloth placemats because I was honestly tired of washing them! These are VERY thin. I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn\u2019t think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I\u2019m not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper! But they look pretty and easy to wipe clean so I\u2019ll see how the durability rates as I put them to use.","Is okay but too hard to get cards out. If you have alot of cards and you push and try to fan them out sometimes cards go flying. would be better without money clip. Elastic for cash would be better.","I love this product but one of the bottles we received does not spray correctly and we had to throw it out. Otherwise, the smell is awesome and great for making smells disappear quickly.","It's listed as a three pack, but it's only 2.","I use it to support my neck while I sleep, because I can't sleep on pillows.","The great thing about this is the POE power supply directly from the DVR saving you a ton of work. You only have to mount the cameras and run the wires (supplied) plug them up and start your settings. I can view my 4 home cameras from ANYWHERE on my cell phone or lap top! It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!! You just scan the bar code symbol and poof, like magic you can see all of your cameras. I give the total package a 9 out of 10. I DO recommend this system.","Shoe is okay loose fit, somewhat comfortable.","It tastes like it hasn\u2019t been sifted. Other brands taste cleaner and better. I can hardly stomach this. Great benefits to my body but it gags me.","One if pictures shown in advertisements shows an ink pad. I assumed it came with it. I didn't. Now I am driving all over town trying to find a green ink pad.","I never received my order. I reached out to the company twice with no response. Very poor customer service.","I haven\u2019t had my Apple Watch protective case that I purchased seems to be fine. I haven\u2019t had it very long. But, so far no complaints.","Perfect fit, nice design, good quality for the price :-)","Came well packaged. Super easy to use. Love how big the caps are. But no recipe book! Don\u2019t advertise it if you aren\u2019t going to send it!! I kind of want a few bucks back just for misleading me!","Fit over my 8mm wires with 90 degree boots on each end. They did however turn black when only slightly touching headers....","Professionally built I\u2019ll be mounting tomorrow.","Worthless, tech support does not even answer back. Not working. Do not buy.","Easy to carry around, set up and fold up. It takes less than 2 min to set it up. Now i don't need to carry those heavy umbrella and chairs to the beach.","there was too much shifting scenes to follow the individual chapters.","This made a nice addition to the wrestling theme of my Grandson's Easter basket!","Does not work at all. Came and does not look like the picture. Fits my husband did not even try on any of my kids as where you would hook up the medicine cup is positioned very wrong.","I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery\u2019s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.","The taste is strange, Stick with the orange mango","The ball appears to be durable but the pump is tedious. It is a plastic hand pump and it is difficult to pup enough air to make it full and then quickly remove the pump and insert the stopper. An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.","It looks nice but it is only facial quality. The rubber tips bend very easily. The wood is cheap wood. And the molly screws broke in my wall and made gigantic holes. So now I have to spackle, paint and redo the whole process which should have been 5 min to do. The molly screws they give are cheap and are WAY too big. Use your own tools for this and you should be fine and it will look nice.","I would not recommend buying if you have narrow feet.","I received two wraps and both are latex free.

My neighbor brought it to me.","I have wanted a pair of Penny Loafers for a long time. Haven't worn them since High School but have had my eye on them for a while. Great quality and fit. One of my favorite purchases.","Works super well. Also works great for other tough cleaning jobs like dried up flour/dough.","I don't really like this aloe gel. I don't like how it smells and texture (very liquid, no like a gel).","Cheesey, so much internal dialogue it bacame whiny, and when she tried to stand up to her father she sounded like a whiny child, she admits it, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant to read.

THEY ARE AWESOME!!","This is what you will get ,it s nothing like the photos they have Very disappointed and I don't know how Amazon can back up like those people never order from them check my photos and compare I through it in the trash","Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it\u2019s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing.

We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.","My daughter really likes the design and colors on this product. It\u2019s easy to hole and drink from. However, it seems to get too much air inside of it- tons of air bubbles. I also don\u2019t like how water gets trapped between the bottle and the handles. If I had a you get child, I wouldn\u2019t use it at all because of all of the air it takes in.","Product was available very quickly. Very nice color. Thinner than I expected.","Quality is not good.","A more than impressive manual. Bought it to learn the fundamentals of Powershell for my job needs and it definitely helped me master the basics through lots of examples and clear explanations. If you're looking to master PS this guide is worth buying","the panels open up sideways making it almost impossible to frame around it, very disappointed.","This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren\u2019t really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn\u2019t be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!","The story capture my attention and the tempo of the story is well organized.","Nice comfortable shoe. Does have wiggle room but, unfortunately, so does the heel. The straps err on the side of too much give which makes the shoe bed too loose. Sad to say but they must be returned. Bye bye cool shoe...","The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.","When I bought this last week I didn't realize it is a \"kit\" which you have to put together yourself. I thought the product was ready to use upon opening the package. That being said, I still haven't used this product and I am thinking of sending it back.","The rings are very bulky and dig into my toes. I can't really wear them while walking around.","Two of 3 units failed within a few weeks on the carriage lights on my garage.","I installed the fan (Second one ordered) and I had to start it with my finger, as it would only move a couple of CMs when first powered up. After turning the blade with my finger and letting it run for an hour, it would then start by itself. It does not instill a feeling of confidence in the product. Their fans are usually top quality.","It's soft and the price was good, but for this particular pillow pet (butterfly), it came apart at a seam during only the 2nd wash and got fuzz EVERYWHERE in our washer (and eventually the dryer as all the clothes covered in fuzz dried out). I stitched it together so we'll see how it goes. If this was my first experience it would be 1 star... but 3 stars because this size pillow pet is great for my daughter at preschool and the unicorn we previously had held up for two years of constant use and washing before it finally got lost/stolen.","no good did not fit, I cut ir a bit to make it fir . worked ok for about 3 day and everything was gone","Sorry! This does not work! Can I send it back? It is useless!","Watery texture. Immediately caused severe itching upon first application. I had to wash it off after 5 minutes.","Never delivered they refunded the money though","Nice and light to wear for summer.","Cheap quality. Break easily","My dentist recommended these tuft brushes to help clean the deep grooves in my chewing teeth (molars). Most regular toothbrushes and even electric tooth brushes do not reach deep enough, which led me to have lots of cavities. It also is great for reaching behind my back most teeth. I use both regular tooth brushes and this brush to clean my deep grooved molars. So glad I found these in economic 3 packs, so worth it...","I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.","There are some reason for 5 stars: -- It's small and lightweight, easy to carry anywhere bcs of it's retractable design. -- Only one cord I need when indeed in charging bcs of it's 3-in-1 design. -- Must value of money there as received 2pcs in one package. -- Fast charge and data sync as there are no any difference in charge and transfer data with my original cord. -- Promptly arrived as arrived within one week. All in one, good quality and convenient.","This cover fits my CharBroil grill but its loose and sloppy. The fabric is very flimsy unlike my previous grill cover which was stiffer and held its shape. this one touches the ground when its on the grill and leaves dirty marks on the top of the grill which i dont know if they will come off now.","A dislike it being all crust open the only thing I like that you had plastic secured to secured on the inside but I'm not happy","Love this stand. I am a teacher (computers) so I need to be moving around the classroom while demonstrating with a projector. So my laptop needs to move with me.

This one does not stay on air vent wing and keeps sleeping off while driving for prolonged periods.

Very low quality of fabric looks untidy.","It's small and a little difficult to read. I would have liked larger text.","These cards don't make sense. The \"Thank you\" has nothing to do with the cartoons on the cards. Several of the cards were misprinted and the cartoon was cut off. I returned them as a result. I'm glad they were misprinted so that I didn't have to keep them. Because of the cartoons, they should be blank inside, not say \"Thank You\"","These silicone straws are amazing!!

Just know that the blast stream is definitely tight and concentrated. So much so that if you turn the pressure too far you could potentially hurt yourself. I recommend turning the control dial slowly up to the point it is going to get uncomfortable. You could use a sharpy to mark where is the \"sweet spot\" pressure point is. A couple other tips are: 1. Use paper to wipe off the initial heavy. 2.

Only after 1 month of light-use (2-3 hours a week), it started degrading. The grip of the strings started to loosen up and no matter how many times you tighten it up it always loosens immediately on playing and causing a weird tone while strumming. That is not how a good guitar should function!","Definitely recommend. Great to have back ups for my kids ipads. I have been used a lots of cables, This is my favorite. General line is too short, I like to lay on bed playing with mobile phone when charging, Always bent. This line solves this problem. Very convenient. And the quality is also very good!

The comb, travel bag and head band were a perfect touch. Thank you !","Ever since I got this phone, I\u2019ve had nothing but trouble in activating the phone. Apparently, the SIM card I received was compatible with Verizon which is not my carrier. After giving me the run around, I was told I needed to buy a T-mobil SIM card. I couldn\u2019t find one locally so I ordered it from Amazon. Two days later, I called Tracfone back to finally activate my new phone and was informed that this new SIM card was still no good. This time around they offered to send me one free of charge. Now, it\u2019s a week later and I have a phone I can\u2019t use. Grrrr..... I can\u2019t understand why Tracfone doesn\u2019t ask you which network is compatible with you phone and send you the correct SIM card BEFORE shipping the phone. My hope is that I\u2019ll receive the correct SIM and get my phone activated once and for all. Otherwise, I\u2019ll send it back.","Item was way to Small","As described. Fast service.","Bought the pedal exerciser for my 87 yr old mother. She loves it and although she is active - even still mows her own lawn, she likes using it when she is inside when the weather is rainy or cool.

However, when you get used to that it is good.","If the stakes are wooden. These things are like dull saw blades ripping their way through the meat. NOT sharp. Returned and very disappointed. Handles are nice. Know that these are made in China.","This box is nice looking, but it's not very functional. Once you get halfway through the box of tissues, it becomes very difficult to access the remaining ones. Much more decorative than it is function for sure.","We bought 4 packs of 10. They are cute! Shipping was quick. However, I'm a little disappointed as to each pack has 50% with the same images, and 1 pack has only 1 pink and the rest are blue. These are how they were packed, and I just put all the faces up to show.","Not sure what was wrong with this moisturizer but since I started using this moisturizer, my face was more oily than it was before and I seen more pimple pop up. After a week of using this, I throw it away. This does seem to be a good moisturizer but maybe it is not for my face type.","Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.","So I bought this fan for a trip to europe which I'm leaving for tomorrow. Lots of the places I'll be staying there won't have air conditioning so I thought this little fan would be the perfect thing. I don't know if the fan I received is defective or what. I put in brand new batteries and could hardly feel any air coming out even with the stupid thing three inches from my face. Then when I tried to take out the batteries, the plastic cover broke and a little metal piece fell off of the battery holder. Seriously don't buy this fan, I'm warning you. You'll just have to throw it away and go out last minute to find one that works!","Unit works good in grass, age appropriate, easy to operate. Design flaw...Have to unscrew battery compartment disconnect low quality connector which will break with repeated use, pull out battery pack to recharge. Unit is slightly overpriced for this reason, otherwise new out of box has been fun. Hopefully it will last, but not confident with connection for battery.","We've been using this to treat IBS and leaky gut, as well as get gut flora back into optimal range after years of medications. Over time we have noticed a huge improvement in regularity and cramps. Very much worth trying!","I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..","The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.","Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged","Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these. They are completely secure. It took a little practice to remove them (use your fingers, not your fingernails, and practice a few times before you put them on) but they are great.","My 4 year old loves MARIO and the adjustability is good, ranges to fit anyone head comfortably. Would purchase again.","Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.","I\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

This bag has better loft than a custom made Top Quilt I bought. Love the colors. Love that head and foot ends cinch up. I close the foot end and use as top quilt. Had a slight odor. I put a dryer sheet in hammock with bag. All good now. This was shipped UPS and they left package at another house. UPS did not follow up with their investigation of where package delivered; so I had to go hunting for it all over neighborhood. Love the USPS. UPS, I have had problems. Just an FYI.","Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.","Hard to use for my 5 & 3 year old.

It looked like they were opened and they put them in the baggies to sell them. Oh well, I am not sure that I will order these again.","I looked around for a few weeks for a GOOD tongue jack for my enclosed trailer. I finally settled on this one which was one of the most expensive ones out there. I don\u2019t mind paying for quality. After opening and installing this jack it worked for about 10 seconds and then quit. It didn\u2019t even let all the way down to the ground before burning up. I do not recommend this jack to anyone. Buy a cheap one and take your chances.","This worked out really well for me. I was consistently getting 90 pumps or water out of the 5 ml size bottle. That is not a typo. Ninety.","I didn't order a case for a iPhone I don't have that phone","Thrilled that it has no aluminum, but does nothing to prevent underarm body odor after sweating.","They're okay but the light swath could be much wider.

Love it.","Didn\u2019t have much luck using them.","Too big for my wrist! (I\u2019m female, early 30s, 5.5\u201d and average body complexity). And it is also too big for my mom\u2019s wrist. I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don\u2019t offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.","These earrings are darling and so lightweight! They go with so many different outfits and are just the right size! I absolutely love them!","gift receiver really pleased","My sensory child hates flavored toothpaste. This really has zero flavor and smell. It foams up a tiny bit, if this is an issue, so I had to run the toothpaste under a little water for my kid.","These candles burn nicely and do not drip.

So far, no problems but I clamp the heater lightly.","The mirrors are very good and fit nicely, however installation is very challenging due to the difficult location of the bolts and nuts.

Too many pages that don't have any kind of meaning for me. The very last page had a small drawing I enlarged and copied. The intricate drawing is what I like about Celtic drawings.

This is a fictional story and the trashy political jabs should have been left out. The story would be just fine without the author interjecting her personal political views. Start a blog if you want to rant about the Trump administration. Don't make your customers pay for it. I made it 20% through and am moving on to something else. Anything else.","I dislike the fact that the same music plays over and over. Should have various genres.","Awesome stuff. Works great. I keep ordering only because she keep dropping the phone in the toilet. I recommend to everyone. Good job guys!","This was a surprisingly good show and the cd doesn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t get tiresome. Playing it over and over. Lots of good songs on here.","First one out of the container did not work no problems with the rest of them good price and easy to write on.","Will only receive a few a channels..","Trucks fell off after a couple hours. Had to use superglue to hold it on.","Pretty disappointed. I soaked these in the sink to remove stickers and the handle rusted before my first use.","One of the stands came broken the other two were super dented its a waste of money im so disappointed ive tried contacting the seller no response ..","Unfortunately, I had to return these due to the slimmer fit. I\u2019m usually a size 8 and the size 8 was good but, the refined model was too tight for me since I have high arches.","works ok but are smaller than i thought they should be i guess that is why they don't sat they are for tractors","Do not buy !! I have no idea where they store their products but there are bedbug eggs in the bed frame! My new mattress I bought last year thrown out \ud83d\ude2d!","Very disappointed upon receiving this. Surface scratched. Will be returning!","I ordered this product a size larger than I normally wear and it was snug. 2 sizes larger would probably have fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. These are easily dressed up for work or to be made more casual.. very versatile","Works great around your nails for clean up. If you use it as a base to keep your nails from being damaged it takes forever to dry.","This works exactly as described. Make sure the seat is tightly secured before putting your child in it.","O.K. for the price. Not so sturdy. Was broken in the first 2 days.","My Crested loves these. He only eats the chicken off but a good treat for him.","In the picture it appears longer. The material is cheap as well.","VERY good. I would buy Again","Installed easily but only lights up if faucet is turned in maximum.","The quality and concept of this product is excellent. So much better than the dial ones, cleaner and less awkward to use. The only difficulty I have is the length the bar extends can be a little can be dangerous when doing skull crushers.","This is the first book in a new series and is set in a small town in Colorado. The main character,. Cassie Collins had been away from her home town for many years and returns home after a bad car accident. She reunites with her best friend, who happens to be a deputy. There is a murder that is very similar to ne that happened 20 years ago and Cassie helps investigate. Well-written and very enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing where this series goes!","rental book in very bad shape","Lovely wooden cover. Well made and very slim. Fits my iPhone 8 Plus well. Would have liked it a bit more snug though. There\u2019s no raised lip on the front to protect the screen so having a full glass screen protector is highly recommended.","Me an my sone loves doing these together!","Not worth your time it is to short and clogged way to easily.","I\u2019ve bought this before with no issue. However, this time they arrived unusable. Totally smashed, but the box was fine. Seems they are sending out defective product. Difficult to see by the picture because it\u2019s such a small item size. Buyer beware. Hoping to hear from the seller, but you know how that goes!","Cookie mix sticks to mold. Then when cookies cook, design disappears. I bought 2 sets, received another for Christmas. I like the cookie press kit lots better. You squeeze the cookie dough through a syringe with a decorative design.","I hope that it lasts longer than the last shoulder bag I purchased!","this product is not up to par. used it for a month, broke, seller did send another one, but used it for a month, and it broke as well. now seller won't send me another.","Feels very heavy and blocks your pores, will not be buying this product again.","This is very similar to the instrument that my doctor uses. They do offer an app to log results which I found extremely difficult to install....I am technically challenged...","These are great! I was going to separate the duplicate pages then discovered there are no duplicate pages!","The flavor is disgusting. I had to stop taking it however, it does work. The taste is just not right.","I enjoyed this book immensely. If you want to figure out how to deal with liberal extremists who continually call you names- this is the book you have to read.","This is just another replacement port that ruins the receiving ability of the phone. Don't worry all 3 different ones I purchased are the same as well. I cleaned the debris I finally found in the old port and the recieving ability is as good as new and the port charges as well. The port you sell is not usable and should not be sold.","Looks like in the picture. It protects my laptop very well. Keep in mind that you won\u2019t be able to use the tablet mode. It\u2019s a great product, however, you can\u2019t increase the degree between keyboard and screen more than 45-50 degrees or the laptop will tilt back a little due to the weight.","Works great easy to use.","Gray remains beautiful. It would have been a better movie had her role been larger. Actually, it would have been a better movie had anything at all been done differently.","4.5 Stars for Lie With Me I love the Stonewall Investigation series and have from the very beginning. I was so glad that author Max Walker didn't stop the series but opened up more offices across the nation and spending time in Miami with the boys. Loved Oliver and Beckham together. I have to say I was shocked at the twist at the end, for the life of me never expected it. That's what I enjoy about reading a Max Walker book, the suspense, mystery and the romance. This is the trifecta for a good read!","Smells wonderful!! Lasts for hours.","I bought a pair of these back in August and have been using them every day at work. They make a world of difference for me, and if I forget them at home one day my eyes really feel it. Most people in the office thought they were real, prescription glasses and were surprised to find out I got them off Amazon purely for staring at the computer screen. I've never had an issue with the quality or anything like that. I'm actually planning on buying another pair to keep at home.","I ordered a size 8 and it fitted true to size. The shoe is cute and very light. The rubber soles are nice for walking around the office. It has minimal cushion support, I suggest getting an insert if you plan on being on your feet for a couple hours.","Works great for walls but a little too big for door frames!","You cannot call out side intercoms. Someone has to ring door bell. My issue is i\u2019ve had two unwelcome visitors that I would have liked to communicate before they broke into vehicles. I don\u2019 Know any criminals that will ring door bell first .","Bought this for my teenager and it is way too big. This would fit a Large head.","These are very comfortable, fit well, and don't slip or slide on the floors.","Product did not work out of the box. The wiring was loose and after fixing the loose wiring, product would work during the test but when installed in the ceiling, no response. Tried 3 times to make it work and finally had to go to local Home Depot and buy another fan which worked right away. Trying to return the product to Amazon.","Instead of a pack of 6 bags 40\" long, I was sent one bag 47\" long!","large might fit to size 8 1/2","Not the color I was expecting","I loved the clock really nice but arrived with one of the points broken. Tried to get issue resolved no help from seller. Loved the clock very unique.giving it a one because seller won't get back to me.","Product arrived warped, in turn didn\u2019t function as intended. Would consider something different.","Perfect for traveling - enough room for phone, credit cards and money!","The kit is almost what you need for the nintendo switch except it has no long handled tweezers and that is a must when working on the small circuit boards and electrical ribbons. If looking for a set for your nintendo pass this one up and get one with tweezers","I love the shoes - they are super comfortable. I ordered a size 8 Wide (which I sometimes wear along with size 8) because they didn\u2019t have size 8 and it is a little too big, but I\u2019m going to keep them since I already wore them.","I really love this walker! The only thing I would warn people about is that it does not work on carpet.","Came as described. Quick shipping and daughter loves it","Love the reinforcement edges, just as pretty in person, and the tabs and pages are usable! I think this calendar will work! I do wish it had more note pages and the ability to add pockets (has one) to the binder. It's a go though!","I was so excited to get this rug cause it looked more plush and fluffy than other rugs I\u2019ve seen. This, however, wasn\u2019t the case. It is indeed a very pretty rug but not as soft as I hoped and unfortunately to me, doesn\u2019t have a good feel to it either.","While the box is solid and arrived promptly there was nothing either to attached or already to installed that allows you to hang the files. You know, the reason why I purchased the box","A fun D.D. Warren short story. The problem with short stories is I always want more. Love Lisa Gardner. Enjoy.","RETIRE BEFORE TWENTY-NINE is the great book. i love this book . this book is the great book. i like this book. thanks author.","Very nice sign, love it","It tastes so good. I love putting it in protein shakes but it is really good to mix with water and put on toast.","Quite possibly the ugliest glasses I've ever bought. I returned them because they offered no protection from sunlight.","One didn\u2019t work so sending both back","The rose design is beautiful and it feels great when holding the case, because it's really smooth. But, the quality of the case is subpar. The corners of the case was not properly glued on so the plastic is sticking out and could possibly come off with normal wear and tear. Would not really recommend this case for long term use.","Should furnish Google's. Dangerous to face.","Probably the longest wearing polish I\u2019ve ever tried. Lasts more than 2 weeks on my toes. No chips ! Love it.","As a beginning of a longer story- a bit disappointing. Extremely religious world, the whole gods system unclear, military fractions mixed up. So, the commander of knights , experienced soldier, during many skirmishes and war didn\u2019t kill anyone? Nonsense. The plague concept interesting, let\u2019s see how the author develops it. Dead who are alive - difficult concept, we can\u2019t be even sure who is in and out, for the whole series a threat, as there might be the case, that those killed in the first volume will be back in the third. I\u2019ll buy the second book anyway to see , where it goes.","The mirror was nice but arrived damaged. I couldn't plug the usb cord into the base because the hole was misaligned. returned it for that reason and ordered a different one.","I have fat calves so I ordered a size larger than I needed to accommodate. I don't want to say that the item is somewhat small for that reason. I was well aware that that could be an issue for me. However, I was able to get my fat calves in them with a little work and am largely comfortable in them.","These are really pretty but smaller than I expected. Package next to a roku remote for perspective.","Awe man I really feel bad for writing a poor rewrite as I see some people have really enjoyed this record player. I got it and out of the box I had issues with the tune arm. I could not get it to stop skipping! Every record I tried I couldn\u2019t get the thing balanced, aside from that the speaker quality was worse than a tin can. I\u2019m so disappointed with this experience. I traded this in for an audio technica and the sound quality is night and day, no skipping! Perfectly clear sound from new records as it should be.","Great vinyl, just wish there wasn't a sticker holding it together. The vinyl itself is perfect for projects.","I received this item and was quite pleased with it. I would not hesitate to purchase another.","It is too sharp but its haft was been flaky after just a month.","It\u2019s just ok for me. I bought it because I thought the towel will dry my wet hair and I don\u2019t need to use hairdryer anymore. Well, I still need to use hairdryer to completely dry my hair.","It's very easy to put on and is comfortable to wear. I just wish I could pull it a little tighter in order to possibly speed up the process.","I am very pleased with the camera, it was easy to install and connecting to the network was simple. I use it to keep an eye on our pets outside and it has been reliable and I have had no problem connecting to it from my iphone","perfect for meal replacement shakes - a little thicker than regular straws but not too thick.","I knocked this tape down 2 stars because it doesn't stick to my skin very well. I have to wrap my thumbs a few times to get it to stick and then during my workout it rolls over itself or loosens more. I really like how flexible the tape is but wish it would stick better.","Not impressed by photo selection. Image quality is generally poor. Anybody can muse on someone else\u2019s photos.","So a dead battery 4 months in.... I have watches that are 5+ years running on the same battery, and this thing couldn't make it 1/2 a year. They should run for at least a year or they should be replaced free of charge.","This book caused me to do as lot of introspection and make quite a few adjustments. EXTREMELY instrumental in freeing up my time and allowing me to focus on the important an not the urgent.","Tug of war, just chewing, and fetch are the usual activities the tire is used for. Likes it better than his puppy kong.","Smaller than it looks","I usually wear 7.5 but I order 8w and it is small","Faster than expected delivery and exactly as ordered! Would definitely use this seller again!","Length is perfect but the sizing is so inconsistent! I bought two pairs to try on, 26, and 27. But the 27 is tighter than 26! And it\u2019s literally an inch smaller...","My husband really wanted this book. I looked and found it here at a great price. He's very happy with it.","I got this for my 4 year old can be a little slow at charging but she loves it good price good product","Excellent all around seasoning.....love it on everything I make.","Love them. Exactly what I needed. Highly recommend...","We ordered 5 boxes and got a wad of vacuum bags stuffed into a USPS envelope that was literally bursting at the seams.","Grandson loved it had great time at party","It does the job of coping the slides to the chip but it's a laborious process. Each slide has to be inserted into a holder and then inserted in the viewer. We hooked it up to the TV so we could both view the slide without having to look over each others shoulder. That went well, as long you have an extra HDMI port on your TV. The quality color is adequate for most slides, but if the slide has poor exposure, this device will only make it worst. The left to right and top to bottom buttons work well and are convenient.","I bought these for my grandsons! They love them!","My musical tree came with no music box and no blanket. Description says otherwise. Waiting on replacement.","The s-pen that it came with didn't work so I had to order a new one.","smells great and my heels are smoother","I bought this because I needed a small soft sided cooler that did not leak. It does that well enough thanks to the hard plastic liner. I've used it once a week for the past 3 weeks. It already has some damage because the zipper tends to get stuck on the flexible inner liner. It does not hold ice overnight.","Beautiful statue. Didn't ship with the legs.","Product arrived damaged the entire case was completely cracked and smashed in though this isn\u2019t the sellers fault it wasn\u2019t the greatest experience especially after I found out I could have purchased this for the same price at my local Best Buy","The ring holder is gorgeous to look at but not very functional. The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings. I also didn't realize how challenging it would be to grab silver jewelry from a silver tray. Glass ring holders are easier for this reason. Still, it's really beautiful to look at.","I use them strictly for walking every morning so it's a bit too early for an honest review. So far so good. Good fit and all.","Went together quite easily. Perfect size. Shelves a little flimsy, but they'll work.","The new recipe is disgusting. I have been buying these for 7 years and will never again. Chalky, artificial tasting. Please go back to the original recipe","Too small for most cell phones","is wrong one for my vehicle but yet I can't return it and get a refund due to I have to pay shipping back for returning product and be charged return shipping fees what good does that do me to return it when will cost almost same as if I just kept the thing ate the loss....","Started to work in minutes...i could see the fleas fall off my cat.","I was excited and they seemed nice (though I meant to order something much smaller), but then I pulled the bottom container off and the edge was cracked and broken.","I loved this necklace and got a TON of compliments on it! However, after owning it for less than 2 months, it broke. The tassel part broke off where it is soldered to the ring. I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful piece of jewelry and so versatile! I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.","120 Quart cooler is pretty big. The picture shows 3 stainless hinges and the product I received TWICE only has 2. I do not believe that 2 hinges will keep the lid from warping or the seal required so I returned them. The price is good and the Amazon service was good, but the picture does not accurately reflect the product shipped.","Tastes like burnt french fries. I don't recommend. I wouldn't buy, they are hard and taste like burnt cheese. The also arrived in pieces and crumbled, hardly any actual squares.","We have a select number king split bed. I'm not happy with this bed bridge because it's not very wide. We can't strap our mattresses together because each side is operated individually. The bridge falls into the split in the middle which then doesn't really serve the purpose its supposed to. I guess its better than nothing.","Is working just like it said my wort is slowly disappearing","This is a very thin protective case with a VERY thin bumper cover. Disappointed with purchase","I bought 2 pairs of these pants and they are great! Very comfortable and they fit very well in all the right places.","My friend is a Great Baker and loves horror movies. When I saw this apron I just had to get it. Of course he loves it.","This is a stunning table and perfect for spring and summer patio furniture. Everything folds to store in the garage during the winter. The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people. Giving it 4 stars because it was a total pain in the rear to put together, and the instructions were awful (no words, and minimal photos). If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.","Bought this as a gift and immediately gave it to my mom because we were so excited. Was I embarrassed. The hammock itself was okay so far after inspection, but all the straps and extra cords were tethered already. We couldnt even set it up because they looked so badly worn already. Now we have to order new straps and get some new cords to hold the net up.","I wish this was on a watch list for all teenagers. Gripping moving and so real. I was totally moved by thhis film.","Arrived promptly, all printed info correct. Unable to figure out how to adjust to fit wrist. Returned and given prompt, no hassle refund.","The Carburetor matched up fine for the motor. The throttle and choke arms were not installed, and would not connect to the existing links. I had to use the old arms to make it work. At the same time the Pressure washer now is always at full throttle and will not idle down.","Very nice pair of reading glasses. They came packaged in a sturdy box and the lenses were wrapped in a cling type plastic. They hold exceptionally well when looking straight down. They don\u2019t squeeze your head and the rubber grips on the earpiece really help keep them in place. I will buy these again when it\u2019s time.","Received a larger size than what I originally ordered. Too big in the chest area.","Construction quality seems good, but i do not always get sugar out of it when dispenser is tipped over. Unfortunately, i am shopping for a traditional dispenser now.","Got it tried to charge it and it didnt work","If you're a Perry fan, this is a killer CD. The harmonies on 'You Better Wait' are IN-sane. There's a lot of heart and soul poured into this album....from the poignant 'Missing You', to his implied apology to former Journey bandmates in 'Anyway'. Definitely recommend this CD!","Love the comfort of these!!","But for my dogs 30 and 50 pounds they need the bigger size. they ate this not chew.","Had to seal the lens gaps in several places that water was passing through","Sensivity of the tablet is not high enough. It works fine otherwise.","This was a huge disappointment! I ordered it for my daughter to take when she moved to NYC. We knew it would be a little while before she could get a real bed and wanted her to be able to use this in the meantime. It did not fully inflate nor did it hold air!","I didn't like the product that much","Was a good product until one of the bands just broke only had a few days","Excellent. Nice big cleaning towel that works great.","Every now and then, I get cracked fingertips. I wash my hands a lot and, perhaps, don't apply lotion enough. These gloves are like magic! I put lotion on at bedtime and slip these on. In the morning - voila! My hands are nice and soft and the ends not sore and dry anymore. I look forward to using these into the wintertime and experiencing such relief!","Do not take the advice of other customers and order a size larger. Order your regular American size...","This has no problem pretty much gluing itself to the pergo floor, but no matter what type of rug I have tried, they all slide around on top of it which completely defeats the purpose. Waste of money.","I thought it was great.... until I found it was missing pages in April right when I needed to schedule my appointments! It only went up to April 13th then straight to May. Who knows if there are more pages missing. I wish I had noticed this when I could still return it. I suggest if you do buy this planner, go through EVERY MONTH and make sure there are no pages missing.","I bought the queen size and it hardly covers just past corners of bed, basically sits on top of mattress. Are you sure you sent a queen, the package says queen, but it's small.","It was broken when it arrived","Beautiful piece, in a nice felt bag with drawstring. Love it!","When I bought expensive furniture, the store recommended this polish. So did a friend who is an interior designer. I have now been using it on fine furniture for about 5 years. It does a nice job and does not leave build-up. Fairly expensive, so you might want to use it on just the good stuff.","It does exactly what I wanted like a deep tissue massage... Very happy 5 Stars....","The charger port cover doesn't fit into the port","The plastic on this product is to soft on the hook area and has no hold for any object that you hang with it.","The shoes were priced low for a reason, the shoes barely lasted a month.","I like smelling and the safety even my bichon Ari lick it it doesn't harm to her but I don't think her facial became really white though. My puppy doesn't have tear stain anyways. I use it for my bichon ari's on face only.","order once just does not work for me .","The vibration is a bit loud but I like the spontaneous play at home or in public. The vibration speeds are average. Overall decent by if u r just looking for a little tease","I purchased these water bottles in 25oz green for travelling internationally. Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)","This is a very short movie, a kind of \"Who dunnit?\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)","Yes yes yes!!!! My daughter loves it and it is a great size!!!!!","I have had it for less than 2 months and water is sprinkling along the hose","The product was used with her new waffle maker","This pin is awesome! It's exactly what I was looking for.","Easy to put up and work great.","Not quite like frying in oil but without the mess and expense of oil. Certainly healthier. But be prepared to adjust your recipes and taste, and you will be thrilled with results. I returned an oil fryer and got this instead. Much happier with this large greaseless device that is more like a baker than a fryer.","I like the community sprite, continued peeks into the family of Bliss. Great to see the new plot unfold. It never appears as you would expect.","I never received the product. Delivered to the wrong address. And there's no way to contact the seller. Don't buy this.","I bought these for my daughter last year, the addition and subtraction were great! But I just pulled the multiplication out to start and half the cards are missing or duplicates. For example, there are three 5x10 cards in a row but no other 5 multiplication tables. Really dissapointed, because I can no longer return.","I think this is much clearer than the projector I bought before I like this very much","Froth made quickly using cold or warm half and half. No place to store both mixers in handle.","Just like every charger I've ever bought, they only fast charge for the first few weeks.","This was a gift for a friend, and he loves it! He sends me a picture every time he uses it and it is so cute!","Perfect for me....but i received broke on one wrist side. Send this back ask for return nerver receive return back..very disappoint...","This case is okay. I does protect my tablet. The body seems well made and not flimsy. There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus. The case fits my Fire HD 8 Tablet, but the inside 'frame' opening is off center, so one side of the tablet face is a bit covered and there isn't room inside the case to shift the table over.","Love at first sight! Amazing how quickly one can fall in love, across the room he sees her & it's over from that point on. It's not easy, but a way is found! Jace & Bethany find their way to forever after!","It's not wooden material which was misleading as when purchased, it wasn't written anywhere on the page stating the material and the caption was \"wood\". The steam is too weak to be used as humidifier. After 1 month using it, it gave a long beep sound when trying to turn on, after the beep it will not turn on so I have to unplug to reset it. This happens often.","Uncomfortable design, can never get it to fit just right. And after working in it a few hours it becomes almost unbearable. Might want to try the full back brace before this.","Product came missing hooks very disappointed","The foil piece doesn't work well at all. And for some reason one week after buying it i changes the head and it didnt work at all. Im very disappointed in this product.","don\u2019t care for the smell of the product","Glue and paint inside the pipe. That's a no from me, but at least it makes for a good prop.","Beautiful dress! I'm 5'7 and 140 pounds. I ordered a small for a tighter fit, but it was still a little loose.","too many items to check","I would have given this skirt 5 stars but both pockets had holes in them. Otherwise, nice fit (I am a size 10-12, ordered a Large) and great length.","Gloves look ok, but arrived defective on both hands","Looks ok considering the price. Started out so pretty, after less than a week of daily wearing, the metal turned copper color. Not enjoyable to wear. Save up your dollar bills for a nicer ring.","I love how the table feels with this on it!","It's exactly what is needed. Does what it's supposed to do.","Enjoyed the detectives. Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series","I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.","Sizes are not accurate","This item is only made of plastic. I have other ice packs that have a soft fabric on one side, eliminating the need to place a \"towel\" next to your skin, as instructed by this one. I wanted to return it, but was not allowed to.","The clip of this starter is terrible and seems like the wrong size most of the time. The entire assembly has fallen apart several times as the tube threading below the battery also seems too loose. The charger plug is simply a 1/8\u201d headphone jack with a hex soldered to it, which broke off after a few times and had to be resoldered after being cut apart. Really unimpressive quality overall - i doubt it will last.","My daughter bought this as pjs but also ended up wearing as a Halloween costume. She loves it!","I really like Tough Headwear's products but I was disappointed with my beige beanie. The beanie is not at all beige. At best, the color is a warm gray. I am satisfied with all of the other colors I ordered (light gray, pink, maroon, army green, dark gray, black, and white) and if I could give them all a separate rating, all would get a 5 out of 5 stars.","I was missing the letter D, which upset me very much! but I didn't want to give 1 star cause I was able to decorate using the other letters and it came out cute! They are really delicate! you have to insert the straw VERY CAREFULLY! 1 small tear ruins the balloons, obviously! :(","I kinda knew when I got this book that it was going to be a sweet romance, which honestly, is rarely my cup of tea. That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.","Had surgery recently and I learned some of the PT exercises. It meets the same standards as the ones provided at the gym.","Grandbaby loves them. Pefect for his size!","Nice case, but I can't use it. It does not fit my Samsung S6 Active. And it isn't returnable.","The stakes don't work in sand.","No it ripped the same day I got it , I want another one.","The design of the shirt feels very cheap. The lettering started cracking after being worn once.","If you're marketing a sports logo item the logo should at least be visible on the front of the item.","The top pouch is starting to come undone. Is there anything that can be done?","The robe is great. Good quality on the cloth itself. The horns are cheap, they don\u2019t hold up. And the cord was not included. If the cord was included I would have given one star more. Would have given 5 stars if everything was included and the horns were not cheap material.","They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.","Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.","Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.","Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel. I broke off a bolt inside the frame where the sway bar attached and had to weld a rivet nut to the frame. Just be aware when installing.","The fitting was not comfortable and the mask was heavy.","Nose-Pad Arm Breaks Easy. Where's The Guarantee. I liked the product but how does one return to ThinOptics without a hassle.","no suprises really, and multiple spelling errors. Good enough to finish, but easy enough to walk away from too. Glad it was a free book.","Car is amazing, assembly is complete. It is fast and flexible when driving. If you are looking for a fast and I mean fast racing style truck, this is it...... Come on! You would not want to missing it.","Some of these smell good and others smell kind of 'ok'. They cause a strong allergy response and causes my nose to burn and other times cause a headache. I stopped using them.","Seems like authentic ink!","Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime. Directions say to turn the top one way to open, but my bottle opens the other way. It took me 4 days trying to open the bottle until I tried the other way. I will probably purchase again.","fits a little loose around tops. but great colors","Not bad for a small assortment of flies for a fast trip, have to make sure there isn't any material protruding outside of the case.","Was able to get it to work once and then it never worked afterward. Shame nintendo is so greedy with their \"official\" dock.","We purchased these radios to use in our care facility for communication purposes and HIPPA compliance. This is the list of issues that my staff have reported: Lots of static, picking up conversations outside of our facility, very hard to hear, some of the ear pieces do not work (staff cannot hear through them) microphones not working, radio volume not working (can barely hear with some of them). Very hit and miss with these radios. Need something more reliable that works consistently.","I thought this was from DEe Zee. This is not Dee Zee. It is a cheap knock-off. The hydraulic arm is so tight it is now a nuisance to wait till the tailgate lowers. It even took my whole body weight and channel locks to pull it out long enough to install from the truckbed to the tailgate. I would never buy this again. In fact I\u2019m returning it and I just installed it.","Very good sturdy thick soft towels.","The book is loaded with useful info to form a new coaching habit! 4 star is because I don\u2019t like the structure of how the book is organized. Like any habit book, if you don\u2019t practice it, you won\u2019t improve.","This fits like a true plus size. I sit right between a 20 and 22, and the 22 fits...ok. The shorts seem low in the back. I'm used to high-waisted swimsuits, so I keep wanting to pull these higher. The mesh lining is poor quality and oddly attached only on the front of the shorts. Worst of all, the outline of your bits 'n pieces are visible through the shorts! I cannot emphasize this enough. It's cameltoe city with these! It's a bummer, because I like the length and fit of these shorts otherwise.","Never received it or refund.","They look and feel great but it does pull your hair on your arm a lot making it so you can not ware them","I had one of the digital gauges from the '80s. Was still working till a friend borrowed it and drove off with it on the trunk only to be destroyed. A good friend would have replaced it. But good friends and good tire gauges are hard to find. So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.","Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply. I did have to use tweezers because I have long nails. It was very sticky on its own. But would recommend using clear lash glue for the extra hold.","It works really well. Its sturdy so it can take punishment but its hard to clean up the mess but all around a great product.","It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.","One of these works fine, the other will not be recognized by my phone.","after just snapping the bracelet once it split open, the inside is a cheap sharp pieces of tape measures.","I like how it helps stand-up. I don't like how to put them on. They don't really help with the knee problem i have. I've only worn them once and look forward to wearing them under and on top of my pants. It's just a little hot now.","Pros : cost, obviously. This is a cheap item but it still works as it\u2019s supposed to. Cons : only one temp setting, hot. So you will need high heat oil / spray etc or it will burn your grease for the waffle and it will taste nasty.","No. Just no. This stuff is thick and cakey....and yes I just put on a few dots. Do not use this if you have any wrinkles because it will settle right in them and make you look older. I gave it 2 stars because the shade was great. The coverage is okay but not worth the definition of my wrinkles.","Seller sending spam to my email...Never will buy from again.","they sure aint what they used to be when i was a kid","This item was damaged. The description wasn't even what it explained it to be. It was supposed to be a gift. Very disappointed.","Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I\u2019ve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring. The colors are definitely a bit more neon than I would have thought, but that\u2019s fine! They do their job of easily distinguishing my keys.","I ordered it 1 size up and it still is a bit tight. I like my shirts to fit a bit looser. But it is a cute top and looks just like the picture.","I\u2019ve had a few sets of bunk beds for my twins. By far this one has been their favorite. It\u2019s very compact and leaves a lot more room in their room. I got the Black and it\u2019s in great shape. I will say this took my husband a few hours to put together. Lots of parts!! The ladder going up was my only issue. The metal hurts my daughter\u2019s feet climbing up/down. I tried a few different things to make it better and then I found my saving grace. A mega pool noodle!! Not just an ordinary one, mega. I cut one precisely and was able to get it perfect! Now she can climb up and down with out it hurting her feet!","Did not work for long and it is very small, when it did work at first it barely did anything to keep us warm","Items lid does not fit top of can. Can Feels half used. Very disappointed.","Works great and I'm still learning how to clean my griddle.","We got some stick-on Magic Sliders and after a few days they started coming off the chairs. After reattaching them a few times, all the glue was gone and they became worthless. If they stayed adhered to the chair legs they would be fine. They slide OK. You are probably better off getting felt pads which will also come off in time, but are a lot cheaper.","I have a spectra 1 pump and it fits in the bag but won\u2019t zip. I\u2019m fine with this as I will only be using it to take my pump to my parents when I visit and possibly to work if I\u2019m still pumping after 12 weeks. It will work for what I need it to but it is small.","Hi, I am loving the drone and it's features. However, one of the batteries that came with the drone is not charging. How can I have that sorted out?","it's still in wraps, but looks like a quality toy from the looks of things.","The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.","My dog is 2 lb. but still looks good on her! Not too big.","I saw it in a review and said what the heck... and low and behold its kinda annoying but I'm going to see if I can get used to it. Otherwise, it's a great mouse. Software is easy to use but you do need to map the buttons.","Broke after a year. Disappointing.","What I do like about this chicken is it always smells so fresh when opening the package. However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry. I think it's the gel absorbent pads they include in the packaging, it probably sucks all of the juice out of the chicken because I don't have that same problem with brands that don't use those pads. I'll stick to chicken that is vacuum-sealed.","My daughter loves her fairy house kit! It has held up nicely in our garden.","Smells great! You don't need to use very much and it's good as a setting spray.","so far so good! easy set up! Gave it 3 stars because it's not really Red! It is more of an orange color! I wanted Red....they could have went darker","Got good news and bad news. Good news is that thia was a cheap product and came on time. Bad news is that its not that great it money worth spent. Theres a reason why its cheap. Just brought a 4k ips uhd tv amd needed a 4k hdmi cable. Just a week in of using it. Thia product kept cutting out the video for reason. And switched it with a 4k hdmi cable from xbox one x and havent had no problems.","Beautiful, as all their pieces are, in my humble opinion.","Plugged and play didn\u2019t have to calibrate went together easy shipped early","Girlfriend completely Loved it! Makes her Macbook look amazing!!","Ok, update to my review... after only 15 months one of the Lasfit bulbs began to flicker on and off. Very disappointing. I was extremely satisfied with the Lasfit headlamps I purchased. A very good value (price was affordable), easy installation (a have a Toyota FJ Cruiser) and great customer support. I recommend Lasfit over the plethora of competitors! The lights produce clean white beams of light, much better than my original factory incandescent bulbs.","It's super cut but a bad fit. Got the Xsmall. However, it's adjustable around the girth but no adjustment for the neck.","I returned the product. The Q&A said it would work fora rug on top of carpeting as well s hard flooring. It did not.","Like the product. Needed security for my Kindle Fire","Flickers when connected to a dimmer switch. Will also flicker if used where the temperature is low.","Made me sicker than a dog","Cute toy. Comes with batteries! 9 month old niece loved it.","Lower on me then I needed. Sits about an inch below my belly. Lace is pretty but it rolls down. Would be better if they were high waist.","While wider than I expected they will be perfect for a short cruise and pattern quite fun.","looked frumpy on me since I'm 5'2'' and gave it to my granddaughter who's a little taller, she seems to like wearing it with leggings.","My computer is without an external CD player. I bought this external DVD player / burner that does the work, without external power supply because there is only one cable, and especially that is recognized and recognizes all my cd / dvd read or write It works fine. compact. so far, so good. Perfect for the money. Very sensitive, do not touch or move when you burn a CD, and there is no noise during burning. It is worth buying.Reasonable price I saw.Recommend.","Seems to be of decent quality just with the fitment was better.","Mounts crooked. Nothing you can do will make it flush and flat. Wish I could get my money back or one that actually works correctly. Not happy wish I could do 0 stars","I haven't used yet. I bought this for an up coming trip to the Dominican. It appears to be built very well but I have not used yet.","Stopped taking a charge after a month. Just blinks red after days of trying to charge it.","It's beautiful, and the quality is very good.","I already buy this but, found it cheaper through here. I love that I don't have to keep buying little boxes in the store ( usually comes with 6) this is a better quantity for me. I eat this in the morning before leaving to work and it holds me good. I recommend this product.","Suppose to be good quality. My pup had the stuffing ripped out the next day. Bummer","Comfy like what I expect from Crocs shoes--can easily wear for 4-6 hours. But as they day goes on & my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants & jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps & backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.","I wanted to keep this swimsuit but it ended up being too small. I wasn't comfortable in it and didn't feel confident. I ended up returning it. I'm 5'5\", 135 lbs, 34D - ordered a Large","I liked this kit a lot, I gave it to my daughter who babysits, and everyone joined in to paint rocks.","This game is fun and not crazy difficult but not super easy either!","For the price, it is good adjustable height ironing board. It does, however, wobbles somewhat because it is light weight. I only iron when I sew (hemming, etc) so it will work fine.","Not ideal for thick hair. It will hold a small french twist if you have a chin length bob but anything longer requires two.","It's a good sturdy item but the issue I have with it is that your feet are to uncomfortably close together to use at the same time","I planted my herb garden in this but had to take a few out as they weren\u2019t doing good. The front middle of each pocket seems to hang and so the water isn\u2019t distributed evenly. Still looks cool.","It's cool but huge and heavy. Like outdoor iron gate pieces on jewelry . Might be your cup of tea.","if you close the drawers all.the way-they are extremely difficult to open again","Very nice case - guys well, good protection","My little one said it is uncomfortable and we have a standard round toilet seat and the training seat would not fit it in!!!!","I was looking forward to taking Mastic Gum. My package arrived. No plastic Seal around the cap and the bottle was open. Wasted time and money. Do not order from them. Get them from somewhere else.","The bag with the hoes was wrinkled and not sealed.A nozzle was attached to the hose.","The texture is great, but this pepperoni is lacking in flavor. I was expecting a bit more spice and herbs. I would rather pick up some pre-sliced mass produced pepperoni from the store.","I ordered a ton of cables for my production studio set up and these cables are well made and for the most part work great. The only problems I've faced is when using them for my audio interface. They have issues and start causing data drops or glitching. Switched cables everything was great.","Thought I was getting votive holders because of the picture but instead got votive candles. Yikes. I do notice it's in the description now that it's too late. The candles are ok but I don't need them.","Very nice knife. Much better than I expected. Fast shipping","As a mattress, it works well for my daughter, but it's been 2 months and the mattress still smells.","These little catheters really help. No gripe water or gas drops will help as this product. My baby sleeps better now.","These are travel size.","This set is absolutely the most beautiful in person than on the website! Very soft to touch but sustainable. And it's wash & dry!","The only problem I have with it is that the stand-up mechanism isn't that stable and we can't adjust the angle.","Right shoe was wider than left.","Helped me adapt a sim card for my hotspot","hi I received the case but it doesn't fit on my lap top,its too big ......can I return it for a smaller size","In the picture this dress looks loose and flowy. Even though it is only 5% spandex it clings to the body. The material is cheap and see through. I would not recommend this dress unless you are looking for fitted dress. Which I was not.","The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit. Thankfully it fit perfectly. Unfortunately the zipper gets stuck so bad. Last night I need help to get the zipper up, today no one can get the zipper up. It's not a size issue it's just the zipper. Ruins the look if the zipper doesn't zip!","I was a little disappointed in the quality of these. The magnets work well and the size fits with the other name brand ones I have but the plastic is definitely thinner than the name brand ones. Overall good buy for the price!","Loved the result but hair see dry","IT IS FINE, NO OTHER COMMENT TO MAKE AS IT WAS SIMPLY A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I SMASHED AT MY DAUGHTER'S HOME.","I am really disappointed with the light output and these are not \"extremely bright.\" I have white LED headlights and I thought that the yellow would contrast and fill in side areas not covered by the headlights. All I see are yellow highlights to each side of the headlight beam. Switch them off and there is barely a difference. To be fair I didn't have opportunity to try these in fog. I'm not sure how you rate longevity but these will probably last forever! Not that it makes much difference since they don't really do much, unlike the OEM lights that they replaced before one go them blew. Perhaps I should have bought the white.","If you like Devin you\u2019ll love it, if you\u2019re new to heavy Devi this is a great place to start.","Works ok decent product","Leaks brushes stain easily","We've had this thing for a long while now. I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.","The band was great until the stitching started to come undone after about 20 days.","Very cute. Quality not the best as the tie began to rip on my second wear. Also it is more robe like as it only ties. Easy to fix with a safety pin.","Out of 12 ornaments 6 were cracked. I guess the 6 functional ones are going to work well for what I need them for haven\u2019t tried yet. Just opened package.","Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.","Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.","for the price it didnt work very good so i sent it back","The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!","I bought this product for when I\u2019m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.","When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!","I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.","The calendar came damaged almost like a scratch on one of the dates. Not a huge deal but kind of a bummer since this wasn't exactly the cheapest calendar I could have purchased on amazon .","Oh my gosh! I hot to see my grand niece in her little outfit yesterday and I think it is the cutest thing ever! The sizing was perfect and the colors, bright and cheery! Her momma loves it and she received many compliments on it. Well made and beautiful fabrics.","My jar tasted like my grandfathers old milking barn smelled. I could not use this.","Totally love this! Very pretty! I\u2019ve seen these years ago and when I found this on Amazon I ordered right away!","It was not what I wanted.","Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.","The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.","I had new sod put in over the summer. I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!","Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat. My dog is not allowed on the couch but just rubbing up against it and the static from this fabric attracts so much white fur. A fine cover, I\u2019d say, for a house with no animals.","My uncle loved the shirt i got it for him material is perfect and tank you seller","It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.","The shoe fits great but feels thin on the sole. But for the money, it's great. Guessing pro soccer players wouldn't be using this but for what I need it for, it works.","I don\u2019t think this got very hot and felt very heavy.","This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.","This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.","..fine to use for light snacks","The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside. My son tried to use his rake to move some dirt around in our raised bed garden and it bent where the tool meets the stake - eventually breaking completely after that. The pieces are fairly flimsy and it is pretty small even for my 2 year old.","Dominos didn\u2019t fit in the slots. Had to return.","This part arrived today not very happy by the quality of this product it\u2019s made very cheap for the price. Will probably be corroded in about 2weeks. I expect to be changing this part very soon","The material is thin and transparent. The threading is already loose prior to wear. They are comfortable otherwise.","Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone","Replacing previous pair that lasted two years and would\u2019ve lasted longer if hubby didn\u2019t where them as slide on slippers at times. These are a good purchase. Heavy duty, made to last, keep feet dry. Comfortable too!","Just felt lose like it was going to fall apart easily.","said juicer / blender - there is no juicer component","SO EASY! I love it! First time with hard floors and I just grab this and sweep up stuff - it works well and is lightweight.","Very good read. Keep me entertained an wanting to come back for more. Vrry intriguing. Loved the storyline an Talon.","I like the color of the bag but the look of the bag could be a little more stylish. Overall, the bag provides enough storage space for all the necessities.","Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.","Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.","I bought this twice. And returned it twice. It arrived with the glass broken in multiple pieces. What's wrong with your shipping department, Amazon???? I'm not the only one who has returned this item because it arrived broken. Please learn how to properly wrap, mark and ship fragile glass. SO DISAPPOINTED!","Does this camera have to be on a HD dvr","Instructions were sometimes difficult to understand, but given it was our very first time trying a murder mystery it was fun. We will do again - hoping for better results now that we (somewhat) know what we\u2019re doing.","Remote stopped working already. Bought new batteries thinking that was the issue but just more money down the drain.","These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I\u2019m impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.","Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.","It\u2019s nice but very disappointed on the way it was packaged, small box in a bigger box, no styrofoam packaging and came opened up in box just flopping around. Hope it works or I\u2019ll be calling for a refund. Thank You!","The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.","Blackout curtains so much better than they used to be. These are a decent size and texture. Perfect length.","There is only one and for the price you can find others online that cone with 2. Very disappointed since the photos show 2.","It didn\u2019t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn\u2019t show in the picture","These are well made, super cute & a great size","I use this for hiking and open water swimming in mountain lakes. The product is well built. It is fairly heavy material. It is very important to have it fully inflated or it drags when you swim. That is why I am giving it three stars.","Water these for my cat was disappointed when recived product had a hole in each side of thumb of glove","It doesn't fit good with the phone, in does not stick in the sides","Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.","Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.","Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere","I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.","Being my first product like this I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\u2019s a decent toy.","Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it. It was so aggravating I almost returned it for that alone. Never again Netgear","This is an addictive, albeit (very) gory game. Frankly, I would not recommend this for teens. I would not recommend it to anyone with aggression issues or anyone from Germany. Contains some boob nudity.","I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.","love it but xl runs a little small... now eating no carbs lol","Was looking for taller pieces with more weight. There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.","Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.","I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.","The scent is more masculine. The product wasnt what I expected.","Work great and good quality","The hatch looked great, fit well and worked well initially. In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover. I had to purchase a metal hatch cover for $26 to replace it. Seller refused to replace it, 1 year warranty, I was 2 weeks outside that window when I emailed them. Run, don't walk from the product and the seller.","Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....","I lake every thing about this camera the colors very clear","I love that this is a rapid charge for two different USB ports! It makes on the go charging a breeze for us! Just plug in your power cord's USB connection and boom you will be all charged up and ready to go before you get to your destination!","Really helps eyeshadow stay on all day.","The seller shipped fast and there was no problems with the order. However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.","(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports. They break easily / are not at all durable. In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.","I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket. The fact that it came from Pakistan makes it pointless to return, I'd probably have as much in shipping charges as I have in the jacket. I can only shake my head at this point !","This is a beautiful product. however is not made for curly hair it pulls and gets tangled.","Is it a strong as I thought it was going to be it's flavorful but lacks the strength in coffee flavor","Very pretty..But you might want to get a larger size up..","This is adorable and just what I was looking for \u2026. a little girl's 4th birthday. The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.","Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.","I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better. The Royal cushion, which I also have, is $25 less and WAY more supportive/comfortable.","This Bear is cute, but it said in the description that it was 20\". As you can see in my photo I attached, it is almost 12\". That is a huge difference to me.","Did not hold up for even one month of play at our club. Fiberboard under attractive painting so did not withstand being left outside. Fell apart.","Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.","Smells good and keeps the bugs away","I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.","Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again","I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \"indoor\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)","Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.","It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old","Exceedingly fake-looking.","Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.","There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.","The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids","I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","It\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off","Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt. Way too much money for the size it is. It looks flat.","Exactly what I wanted! I have 3 cams outside. They are under sheds, so cannot talk about how weatherproof they are. But they, for sure, look nice.","This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item! My family and I totally loved it!","But definitely order 1 size large then most, very cheap fabric, but it\u2019s being used for a costume so will do","only for indoor application. if you have no lip on the inside, it has to go on the outside. the magnets dont stick tightly at all, big gaps especially corners where insects will come in. i do not recommend.","Battery did not power up my watch .","Works great for my Deebot!","The only thing I didnt like was that the pointy part of the velcro is too thick and I'm constantly afraid it might poke my baby. I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.","The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.","Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.","Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.","Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2\" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5\" range instead of stopping at 3\". Still a handy tool though.","OK, but crumbly and stale.","Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since","I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.","I have an older mule that I use for riding 4 or 5 times a week and I love it. This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding","One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty","brass fittings very thin","This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.","This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!","For the price it\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider","As promised...it works!","A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.","Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy. Buttons are flimsy and toy does not always react fast to the commands. The main positive is that the toy is sturdy.","Too big for my Christmas tree... is good material but too big.","Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.","Works great in the bright florida sun.","I love this case it fits perfect for my Mac Pro 15 inch, the cover is soft and the design is nice. Love that it comes with a screen protector, it does bubble up a bit","It is easy to use & it works. Have only used it once.","Chipped wood when it arrived","I have not burned my old chair yet. I\u2019m sure the new chair it will fit & look good.","This kit is designed too small ,and the location is too high for the phone to place on ,I can see only half the screen.","Dissapointing product","Great idea and format, but lacks answers to exercises. The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).","Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!","I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade. You must be careful or you can nick or cut a pet easily. Probably a great tool for professionals or experienced groomers or if your pet stays fairly still when trimming.","wait and see how it works this winter","Perfect for what i needed it for ...","Very inconsistent in connection.","Received a completely plain white t shirt!","very hard and uncomfortable.","Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.","I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.","Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \u201cclean out\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!"],"topic":["26: good screen fast fit watch design charger","6: bag longer hours day feet lasted pump","0: 5 4 give stars light charge reason","0: 5 4

<p>Looking at the chart above, it seems that the topics identified by LDA re not necessarily close to each other on the chart. We know that the chart should align well with topics identified by SentenceBert embeddings, so this confirms that both approaches are complementary and can result in a different set of topics.</p>
<p>My intuition is that BERTopic should work better for shorter documents, that are more likely to represent a single topic, while LDA may handle better longer texts that are likely a combination of topics. Both can offer some good insights into our documents, so it makes sense to try both!</p>
<p>Let's also look at the LDA topics visualizations through the PyLDAVis library.</p>
